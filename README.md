# EDL-2018

this repo contains part of work I did for EDL-2018.

 * data cleaning and pre-processing code, you might re-use them for CoNLL-like dataset.

 * dataset analysis for TAC and RPI_Blender data.

 * some baseline performance (on RPI_Blender dataset) from vanilla models where all the hyperparameters are kept as default.
