<img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/fingerscrossed.gif"/> hiya everyone. I'm here for help and a new community network.
Is this forum easy to navigate?
I see it's got every country advertised. How do I just get posts for France?
I'm taking French lessons to improve my French speach but its going slow.
My son is 5 years old and has been at the local school for 6 months and he understands 90% of French he hears. With I could get as much French spoken to me as he does.
The but... In my title is I'm struggling for work. I'm willing to do anything. I live with my parents and we are moving further south in a few months. Wondering if anyone on here is in the Charente maritime area of France and can give any advice on any thing in the area please. <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/confused.gif"/>
