- while U.S. space program is reduced to begging the Russians for rides Guest post by Investor's Business Daily Unexceptional: China becomes the third country to land a spacecraft on the moon in preparation for a manned visit. Meanwhile, U.S. astronauts have to ride Russian spacecraft to fix toilets on the International Space Station. Tourists visiting the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where one of America's retired space shuttles now resides, were no doubt able to see news reports of the landing of China's first lunar vehicle, a solar-powered rover, on the surface of the moon. This goes along with my APOD post today and shows how much we've shut down our space program and NASA. It also means that China is gaining the technology to become a threat to the US.

...And corners helium-3 market. Though they weren't very good given unmanned launch vehicles can do the same thing for a helluva lot cheaper, President Obama's scrapping of the US manned space flight program was a huge mistake. Without space, having a great Air Force doesn't amount to much. If you don't control the high ground, you don't control squat.

For all those people that think Oblama killed NASA you should hop on over to their website and see what it is they are doing. new space telescope, deep space exploration vehicles, humans abilities to live in space during long periods of time. Or you could just post ignorance on this thread so we can laugh at you.

Personally, I think manned space exploration is impractical I prefer R2D2 to Buck Rogers

Mr. H. said: ↑ Somewhere on that rover is a "Made In China" stamp. Or two... Excellent point... We can leave a plaque behind that says this mission was funded and made possible by the money we borrowed from the generous people of the glorious republic of China.

America abandoned the space race when somebody pointed out how many food stamps could have been bought instead.
