China is committing suicide..

A friend of mine went to Bejing a few yrs ago and her biggest impression was the pollution. She is not chemically sensitive or anything (she smokes a pack aday), but the 30 ft trip from the cab to the hotel door left her wheezing and dizzy.

China has a long track record of ecological "rape". A few yrs ago they killed an entire river system with a spill of toxins. The people living downstrem from the spill only learned of it from international/internet sources.

We buy real cheap products from China.. socket sets for $19.99, shoes for under $15.. etc. Walmart, Target and many other retailers keep theior prices low by using China's cheap labour and lax enviromental laws.

They use dirty coal to make electricity to smelt dirty metals and dirty plastics at a rate that makes the excesses of the western industrial revolution look like a picnic.

China will be a toxic dessert in 50 yrs (or less) if they keep this up.

Your response?

What can we do?

BTW, someone will pick you up on the 'dessert' thing, so it might as well be me.

Hmmm. I wonder how she would have coped during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smog_of_1952">Great Smog of London</a> which led to 4,000-12,000 deaths depending on how you slice the numbers. My mother worked in London during the sixties and would commute with a scarf over her nose &amp; mouth, which would be black with soot and dirt after a single journey.

Sounds a bit like the Rhine

<quote>
The river did not become Europeâ€™s cesspit until the mid-twentieth century. Huge amounts of liquid waste, mostly from towns, farms and expanding industries, were dumped into the river with impunity. The level of phosphates from fertilisers and household products such as detergents reached alarming levels. The fish population dwindled and in 1935 salmon vanished entirely. It was also increasingly difficult to draw drinkable water from the river, and it often smelt like carbolic acid and tasted salty.

and then of course in 1986 it was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/1/newsid_4679000/4679789.stm">poisoned again</a>.

Assuming you mean a desert rather than e.g. a mercury pavlova, then yes, it will. We await the future with hope and trepidation, to see whether China does what Europe and the US did when they were in exactly the same situation and cleans itself up.

One difference being that China is ruled by authoritarians who may well choose the 'Ignore it' method of solving such problems. Not the sort of people who'll care about the fate of a bunch of "cancer villages" if it means they can make more profits in the short term by dumping more poison.

Good Point Der trihs

China's autocratic rule means that they can basically get away with it long beyond what would be considered a social "tipping point" in the western world.

Given that, which I failed to mention, I really do feel as if China has really "bet the farm" on its current rush towards heavy industrialization...

Is this not a necessary part of China's development? After all, the West went through this stage. They'll deal with it when they can afford to do so. Sure it may be 50 or 100 years, but the Chinese do take the longer view.
