Could Edward Snowden sail a yacht from Russia to Venezuela?

A chartered flight that flew exclusively in international airspace between Russia and Venezuela is estimated to cost $250,000.

The reason it's so expensive is that the trip is extremely difficult, at the edge of the range of a Gulfstream G550. Apparently, it's not even possible to do it and meet reserve fuel requirements. There are supposedly to be places the plane could stop for fuel, and have some chance of success.

That 250k price tag assumes an owner of one of these aircraft is willing to take the risk at all. According to this source, 250k is close to the sticker price for such a trip normally. <a href="http://blog.privatefly.com/edward-snowden-fly-private-jet-moscow-ecuador">http://blog.privatefly.com/edward-sn...moscow-ecuador</a>

Anyways, another thing that costs approximately 250k is a brand new, high end, ocean going yacht about 40 feet long. The people helping Snowden could purchase a used yacht of the appropriate size for a tiny fraction of that cost, and load it up with enough food and supplies for the journey. He'd leave in the summertime, possibly, and sail through the arctic on a great circle route past Scandinavia, and so forth, remaining in international waters. Legally, the yacht would be registered in either Russia or Venezuela.

I've never sailed on the ocean, merely freshwater lakes, and I'm not certain how practical this journey would be. Late summer/early Fall, when the arctic ice has melted happens to be hurricane season. Also, I'm not certain if enough of the ice does melt for such a trip to be made in this type of boat. He might have to take a route that went through the Mediterranean. Apparently, the Strait of Gibraltar is considered international waters. An ocean going yacht with a keel that is able to right itself after being knocked down in a storm is slow, with the longer ones being faster but requiring more crew.

I'm sure some of the members here do have such sailing experience, and can tell me the chance he could make such a journey without having to stop anywhere along the way due to a breakdown or running out of supplies.

Although, even if that happened, couldn't he send an encrypted message to his supporters and have supplies brought via another boat to a rendevouz point in the ocean somewhere?

And second, there must be legal buffs who can tell me if the United States could legally stop him on the journey. Furthermore, since yachts are so slow, they could readily stop him with a warship and place him under arrest, legal or not. How would the appropriate Federal courts view this kind of arrest?

As per the second question: the US has arrested people it wanted badly enough in Italian airspace. Why would it be any different in international waters?

He could go from the Pacific Coast of Russia and then around Cape Horn. He could also go east of NZ and Australia and then south and west and around the Cape of Good Hope. These routes would be navigationally very hard (the Capes are hell) in a yacht but would keep him in international waters at all times.

He could go from Murmansk which is ice free year round but he would have to pass through Scandinavian waters.

People sail around the world solo without stopping in races all the time, and plenty have done it in yachts no bigger than 40 feet. Obviously he could suffer breakdowns and illness and accident but these journeys are entirely plausible if hazardous possibilities.

I won't comment on whether the US could legally stop him. I don't doubt the US might stop him, and I don't doubt they could do so if they knew he was doing it.

If Russia sent him on his way and if (if) they kept the whole thing quiet it could be that the US would never come to hear about the journey. I don't know if Norway has any regular program of stopping and searching private yachts coming through their waters. They may well not.

Once he was through into the Atlantic international waters, there is no regular program of stopping and searching yachts as far as I know.

So it is entirely conceivable he could just sail out of Murmansk and not touch land or make contact with anyone till he makes landfall in Venezuala.
