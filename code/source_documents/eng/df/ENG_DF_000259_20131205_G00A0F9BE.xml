I can't think what to say.

I think it was hardly unexpected, and lord knows he's done enough in this lifetime. RIP Mr. Mandela.

Yes, RIP, what an incredible life.

His timing however, sucks. I already had him penciled in my 2014 Death Pool.

Whichever, he deserves the peace he'll have now.

I'd say when you're 95, it's never really unexpected.

Still, I'm sorry to hear of his death.

The end of an incredible journey by a man who had the courage of his convictions. I wonder if they'll tack a trailer obit onto the new film.

He helped make history in South Africa. Now Mandela can rest with MLK, Gandhi, and other champions of freedom. Imagine the stories they can share with each other.

R.I.P.

Agreed, but you just know the media, social and otherwise, is going to lose its collective mind over this. I hope the coverage is as dignified as he was.

Mandela leaves a tremendous legacy behind. In 200 years, his name will still be invoked in South Africa, as George Washington's is in the U.S.

Yep. I know... it's going to be one long outpouring of... something. Lots of people trying to outdo each other in grief, and I'm worried about what's going to happen to his political and social legacy. I would love to think the coverage will be dignified, but I fear it won't be.

I was a bit confused, because just yesterday or the day before, there was a news report about how he was fighting from his deathbed. I hadn't thought the end would be quite so close. But yes, he was undoubtedly one of the foremost people of the 20th century, and I was reflecting the other day on "quiet" revolutionaries, who managed in their own way, to change the world in a tremendous way. Mandela, Gandhi, MLK - they shook and changed societies.

I'm not sad at his passing, but glad that he went, at a great age, in his own bed, surrounded by his family. That seemed an unlikely outcome for the longest time. There have been very few who have changed the world by sheer force of character, and even fewer who have done so for the better. He'll be missed, and we could do with a few more like him.

Nicely put Baron Greenback. He led his country peacefully from apartheid to democracy, an almost unbelievable feat. Rest in peace, Mr. Mandela, and thank you.

(For anyone else who's as completely out of the movie loop as I am, I think <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2304771/">this</a> is what Chefguy is referring to.)

RIP. What a life...

I was only 10 when he became president of South Africa, and it wasn't until years later that I learned about the road he took to get there.

He achieved more in one lifetime than most of us could in two or three.

So who is the nigh universally-agreed Greatest Statesman now?

My mom's first reaction was whether they'll cancel tonights live Sound of Music broadcast. I reassured her they wouldn't dare. Not after such a large cast spent weeks rehearsing.

But I bet the news division wants desperately to run their Mandela coverage.
