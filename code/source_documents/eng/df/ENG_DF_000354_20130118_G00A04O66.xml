If youre a WWII history buff like I am this will absolutely blow your mind. The video below shows members of the Free Syrian Army who are fighting against the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that have stumbled upon a contrainer full of rifles. The rebel member who posted the video mistakenly claimed that they had found 5,000 AK-47s. Nope, turns out they stumbed upon 5,000 German WWII STG-44 rifles.

I think those are going for $20K each. That would be a cool $100 mil.

i dont think the germans made but about 150k of those, most were useless after a b17 group couldnt see its primary target and its secondary was the ammo factory for the stg44.
