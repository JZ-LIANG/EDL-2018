ok I thought I had heard that the head guy in Syria was now living on a ship out at sea and transporting back and forth via helicopter for state meetings etc. I also thought it was a russian protected ship he was staying on...

I remember that because I thought of them using bio/chem warfare on their own people to win the civil war going on over there. I thought the only thing stopping him from unleashing something really nasty would be him staying there. Once he was gone he could unleash anything he wanted, and then go back to what ever was left when it was done.

If they're evacuating the russians it would make me think they are at that breaking point where they are going to do something really nasty and want to minimize the casualties of their allies.

It might not be a bio/chem attack, but it will be mighty bloody nasty either way.

I doubt they would "turn it to glass" because in the end, they still want control of the land, and they wouldn't want it useless...

All that being said, I didn't fact check any of it, and I very well may have things confused. It's not something I dug into, just something I remember reading a week or so ago. Forgive me if I got that wrong...

Either way, it doesn't sound good for syria.

Well, if we believe all the news that Syria loaded the chemical weapons onto the missiles or whatever.........and that was on Dec 5, 2012. Again, supposedly, they have a shelf life of 60 days once loaded. So, again, if we believe in this scenario, then the end of the 60 days would put around Feb 5, 2013. So, in theory, they have to be used within the next 13 days.

Again......if any/part/all of it is true. Maybe that is part of the reason for the above news story.

Who knows. More than likely nothing will happen.

The Russians learned their lesson in Afganistan. I imagine the next biggie, they'll just bomb the hell out of it with no ground troops.

This is an interesting thread/topic to follow. Russia has always been the "sleeping giant" and I have a sneaky suspicion they will become involved in Syria. To what extent remains to be seen, but we all know Bambi and (if he's confirmed) Hagel aren't going to do crap. Combine this with Kerry and Israel better start praying if they aren't already.

The Russians even gave the United States some advice when we first went in.

Make it fast,,,and make it quick!

Yes, today the Russian government says for no one to panic since it's not an evacuation. Tomorrow they'll say "Run!"
