Cyprus basically stole 6.75% of the money in savings accounts of less than 100,000 euros and 10% for those above 100,000 euros in order to pay back its bailout. They called this a "tax" of course.

That's exactly what I was thinking. Why do you think they want our guns so badly? It isn't about some school children getting killed. Kids are getting murdered by the 1,000's here in the US in the ghettos of Detroit, Chicago, Oakland. You don't see them trying to stop that.

This is about robbery and control. <img src="http://www.survivalistboards.com/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>

you have to wonder how long until the US does the same thing.

To be honest, this has been on the cards for some time now. Maybe those who are now being fleeced will wake up and maybe people throughout Europe will take this to heart and reduce their accounts to a minimum.
@Mogli
My guess would be that we are either in/or coming up to the end game.
The system is dying and they know it.

Not to buy into conspiracy theories...but could this be TPTB "testing the fence" of how far they can go?

Small test..small country, lots of expats,

In the US we call this quantitative easing.

It produces inflation and results in the same thing.

Since the Euro is not the worlds reserve currency, they have to resort to outright theft.

Makes me wonder how much currency devaluation the Fed has planned.

People in Cyprus have reacted with shock to news of a one-off levy of up to 10% on savings as part of a 10bn-euro (Â£8.7bn; $13bn) bailout agreed in Brussels.

<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21814325">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21814325</a>

It appears that the Government of Cyprus has allowed the banks to take 6.75% from everyone with less than 100,000 euro in their accounts and 10% if over 100K.
No warning just going, going gone.

It appears the banks also closed till Tuesday to keep people from getting what was left out of their accounts except what they could get through ATM's

Our 401K and savings accounts probably look pretty tasty to the Government right now or will as soon as they can't sell any more bonds. <img src="http://www.survivalistboards.com/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>

Yet another reason not to keep the bulk of my FRN in a conventional bank.

I keep the bulk of my money not 20' from where I am sitting. Screw these banks and their cards and schemes.

To Comment on what KCFirepower said.
If you read the story they think that almost half the money in the banks was actually from Russian nationals that had done just that. They had put their money in Cyprus to keep it from happing in Russia. Instead it happened where they moved their money to instead.

So if you decided to put your money off shore where would you put it? Is anyplace safe at the moment?

They could just a easily do it to our IRA and 401K
They could just decide that 20% of your 401K now has to be in 50 year Zero Coupon Bonds. Poof 20% of your retirement is gone with a few keystrokes of a computer.
