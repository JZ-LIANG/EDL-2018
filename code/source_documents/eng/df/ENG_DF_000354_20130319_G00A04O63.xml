To anyone who works at a bank

With the recent events in Cyprus, has anyone on this forum who works at a bank noticed any customers closing accounts or withdrawing large portions of their savings perhaps for fear of similar events occurring here?

Not looking for specifics or amounts, just if the fear is taking grip here as it is being portrayed in other EU countries that are in trouble like Italy, Spain or Portugal?

This is something we're not likely to hear on the MSM.

Please and thank you.

I have breakfast at a local gas station/country-store and kvetch with the same twenty people almost everyday. Including the lady who manages the local bank. None of them had heard of it. I had the Daily News, NO STORY.

WTH? The US is becoming a mushroom farm.

Actually, Greece's public debt is between $400 and $600 billion.

You missed my point, Alfred E. Newman. But that is okay, anyone who can remain so young after 40 years must be on to something.

There's more the TV media is not telling you that you should be aware of. Probably wouldn't hurt to skim the Financial forum on occasion to see what they're talking about. Very weird times.

I don't work in a bank, but the people I know that do have said there have been people drawing down their accounts to almost nothing. But this started well before the Cypress issue. I guess the awake people haven't told the sheeple. I would also say that there is a type of run on banks and it has been going on for a while.

Whether or not this happens in Cyprus or not, it will happen sooner or later probably in many nations world wide. As its been said many times, "Give a man a gun he can rob a bank, Give a man a bank and he can rob the world"

Yes, they voted it down after the people gave them loud feedback. But the issue is that they even thought of it. That the EU wanted it. I think that many of the people have lost a lot of trust in their government for bringing it up and have lost faith in the banks as a safe haven for their savings. When the banks open I would not be surprised to see a bank run.

Cyprus is off the coast of Syria. Russia is heavily involved in Syria. Now Russia is going to bail out Cyprus. The borrower is the slave of the lender. Cyprus is now going to fall into the Russian hegemony, and Syria is going to be solidified.

While the "West" is borrowing and spending to re-arrange the deck chairs on the Titanic, countries with resolve like Russia and China are in a massive de-facto land grab, and are taking over the world.

The 15th-19th centuries were Imperialism 101. Now we're seeing Imperialism 201. And we're the underclassmen trying to keep up with our better educated peers on the other side. No sooner did we beat Communism, than those same countries started beating us.
