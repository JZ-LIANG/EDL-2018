If they did this to start off with they might have saved people from running on the bank. Its to late now they're screwed. Every day, everyone is going to take out as much as they can until its all gone.

Yes, they have avoided default... but at what price?

So they're not 'taxing' people anymore, but they're still going to wipe out some depositors in BoC. It's better than the completely idiotic wealth tax that was the initial proposal, but not appreciably if you happen to bank at BoC.

Instead of a tax on savings now the over 100k euro depositors in the banks will take a "forced loss." Other than semantics, what's the difference, anybody know?

I think we're using toes at this point.

All they might have done is buy a little time. That is all anyone can do at this stage.
There is no fix. Period.
My take is that there are basically two options
1. Reset/Collapse(freedom)
2. World wide tyranny

Exactly.

There isn't one.

I have a question?

Am I the only one that has been surprised by the reactions of people in the other countries that are in trouble?

If I were in a country like Greece, Spain, Italy, or Portugal I would have been down that first weekend cleaning out my accounts. IF there has been a run on the banks in other countries I have not seen anything about it posted anywhere or seen any news stories about it even on the fringe websites.

I’m lost on this and the only things I can think are that people have lived so far beyond their means that they just don’t have anything left in the banks or they are so oblivious to what is going on that they just don’t care. I know around here it is the oblivious reason. We were over at our in-laws this weekend and asked them what they thought about what was going on and they didn’t know a thing about it. Once we explained it they gave it a shrug and could not have cared less.

Even if you buy into the company line that if you have less than a 100K your money is safe people have to have seen that the last week stores went to cash only and people didn’t have it. Even if you took out enough cash for a few weeks there would have been a huge surge in bank withdraws and I have not seen anything on that either.

I guess this just supports the old saying “None are so blind as those who will not see”
