If they thought that the Government of the day would support them........YES.

Sadly, our NZ Government is in the process of attempting to pass just that supporting legislation at the moment.............and as most of our banks ( apart from 2) are Australian owned and controlled, it will flow through to your country.

And the name is "Banksters" not Bankers.

Spot on.............and then it will be too late for poor John Citizen to get any of cash out of his account. BUT, FEAR NOT................those Fat Cats who move thei ill gotten gains around the world will be safe. As an example, all the Russian cash (up to or possibly even exceeding twenty billion Euros, according to some estimates) which the EU had its greedy eyes on, in Cypriot banks may not be there any more!
No one knows exactly how much money has left Cyprus' banks, or where it has gone. but the two banks at the centre of the crisis - Cyprus Popular Bank, also known as Laiki, and Bank of Cyprus - have units in London which remained open throughout the week and placed no limits on withdrawals. Bank of Cyprus also owns 80 percent of Russia's Uniastrum Bank, which put no restrictions on withdrawals in Russia. Russians were among Cypriot banks' largest depositors.

By Sunday, one participant in the negotiations said, there was almost no capital left in Laiki, a bank whose market value peaked at 8.1 billion euros in November 2007. Laiki's former vice chairman Pavlou disagreed, estimating there had been 2.5 billion euros in foreign deposits alone.

I'm not sure...

On the "No we're safe side"

Our government still has cash to bail out depositors as we haven't had to re-cap our banks (yet).
Gillard is desperate for re-election so wouldn't do it and if she wins knows they're looking for an excuse to ditch her.
Abbott if he is elected won't want to do it as he's only just got power
Aussies haven't been beaten down like most of Europe through austerity so we'd not be happy and the government must expect blow-back.

On the "Yes, they'll take it side"

Our banks are ridiculously large, especially when compared to European banks meaning 'saving' them will be a large undertaking
Our banks own masses of over-valued properties and need at least 40% of their funding from overseas sources.

If it's a 'small' crisis, I think they'd bail everyone out.

For a larger crisis, I think our government would probably now do a half/half approach (which I agree with) i.e. equity and bond investors take a hit, depositors (regardless of size of account) are all safe.

But this is easy for me to say as I don't have much to keep in the bank! Your money, your choice.

Australian banks, like the US banks, have the ability to print money, therefore they wont need to do it, they will just print (and confiscate wealth via inflation)

it could go either way, were already losing wealth through inflation, but considering they are grabbing money out of accounts that havent been touched in 3 years it wouldnt surprise me that if a crisis arose that they did the same as in cyprus.
