It started because terrorist wanting to fight our forces in Iraq came through Syria. We let this border be the weak crossing because the terrain best suited our ability to fight. We formed a "V" like funnel starting at each end if the Syrian Iraq border.

This was only one of the ingenious strategies used by the Bush administration's War Against Terrorist." We picked the battlefield. We used heavy bombardment in the areas of fortifications. This forced them out of their plan. Which was to take us on like they did the Russians. Additionally this cut off their command and control therefore the leadership could not effectively formulate a new strategy. Intelligence told us there were terrorist sells had been deployed all over the world. We fed them misinformation getting them to join the fight in Iraq. Where be killed countless terrorist. The strategy worked until we expanded our efforts in Afghanistan. Now we are bogged down. We should have stayed with the pre-Obama strategy of keeping boots on the ground in Afghanistan to a minimum and using small rapid deployment forces to move in attack and move out.

The answer to your question is this strategy caused many non-Syrians to relocate in Syria. The Syrian government came under attack because they were not aggressive enough against the west. Plus they were seen as not joining the fight against us in Iraq. Finely that is what Muslims do fight for Salvation. That is the only way Allah looks favorably on Muslims. Fight is what Muslims do.

thanks for the quick reply! So it seems like the USA wanted the rebel forces to go against syria by putting them in syria and having syria not help them? and now that the US and EU are wanting to and going to arm the rebels could it be that that was their plan in the first place to take over and control a oil rich country? since tptb "control" al queda and use them for dirty work they dont want to be involved in by the mainstream eyes

We did not want (Bush strategy) this consequence but selected the best war strategy.

I believe Obama withdrew security from Benghazi and spread the rumor that Stevens was gay because he was going public with our arming of terrorist in Syria.

Notice the focus is on bad public information and the real issue. Obama had Stevens and the few that attempted to save him murdered!

Did you REALLY want to know answer on this question? Write me private message in case you did.

In a few words - Qatar need free land for gas transportation to Europe.
US government needs free stateless and borderless territory in the ME with primitive but indoctrinated people armed only with light armament which are easily controlled via UAV.
