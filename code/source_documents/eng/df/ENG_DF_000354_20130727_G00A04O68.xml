Apparently Obammy wants to send arms to the rebels.
I'm sure they wont be used against us, just like in Afghanistan.

Like the White House and CIAs best buddy, Mujahadeen leader Usama Bin Laden, Al-Q is taking black money and doing dirty work in Nation destroying, that our legitimate goverment can't do openly.

The USA sponsors terrorists around the Globe, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria, Venezeula ect. When would be a good time to explain this to the sheeople, so they understand?

Yeah good theory, but they targeted civilians in Boston, not fellow Muzzies in the WH. So it's not working. Arm everyone and let God and the Devil have their war!

Those were Chechens, not Syrians.

I said they were Muzzies not Syians. After all are the Al-Q in Syria, Syrians? Not all of them, but they are Muzzies, and the OP was asking for a Muzzie vs. Muzzie murderfest.

We should be helping Assad get his country back as he is the best chance at maintaining stability in that country. We screwed up Iraq,Egypt and Libya so why we think Syria would turn out better is beyond me. Its like that definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result...Arm Assad and he will take care of the local Al Q population for us. At one time that is what we wanted.

Your last sentence is frightening, in a way. To engage in a global theocratic war would be fulfilling the darker regions of prophecy. Matt. 24:6, for instance. <img src="http://www.survivalistboards.com/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>
