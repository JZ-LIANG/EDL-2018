having visited beijing, shanghai, and a few other heavily populated areas on the mainlaind, I can tell you that the pollution there is overwhelming.

You ask why the enviroweenies dont complain about China...it is because they are not given a stage to do so. There is no freedom of speech in Communist China...dont let the media fool you. The government there does not allow the sheep to have access to youtube, facebook, or any other social media where criticism may be posted.

I cringe whenever I hear the idiots in this country pontificate that the US must strive to be more like (the euroweenie socialist craphole countries in) Europe (I have traveled there extensively, also), or places like China.

Wow, with smog that dense you would think it would make your eyes burn/water. We need to give Al Gore a one way ticket to China, so he can set them straight.

Wow. Why aren't the people dropping dead in the streets over there? Or maybe they are and it's just not being reported.

In Beijing the air is quite visible. It has to do with the obvious sources of pollution and the weather patterns and proximity to the desert to the west. Ive never seen the entire length of the wall surrounding the Forbidden City. At a distance of about 500-meters the perimeter wall just fades into the haze.

As you travel west the air quality dramatically improves. The air in Chengdu the capital of Sichuan province is breathable.

Eventually the Chinese will pay a heavy price for their carelessness and greed. But for now its all about making your fortune.

Just like we did. Invest in the cheapest energy possible, then worry about the environment when you have advanced enough to be able to afford to do so.

Imagine how bad it would be if they didn't get rid of some pollution by dumping it in their exports!

Problem with that (for them) is that when we in N.A. industrialized we had 1/15th the population they do, and way more area to do it in.

The old Soviet Union was known for their disregard of the environment, China is making them look like lefty tree-huggers by comparison.

Sad thing is, you can't really blame them though. Their population wants a higher standard of living, and that's just normal. We rip down nature to prosper here too, it's just that there's so many of them.
