This is why we prepare folks.

-Secretary Mar Roxas denied law and order were breaking down. "It is wrong to say there is lawlessness in the city," he told reporters.

All one needs to do is turn on ANY MSM &amp; to deny there's lawlessness is to deny reality.

Looting turns deadly as typhoon aid efforts spur desperation

I can see looting in this situation --- for food, water, and medicine in the face of devastation and starvation. I think that looting is a cultural thing. In Japan, when there was the last major disaster, there was virtually NO looting. People there are law abiding, respectful, humble, hard working and have little or no sense of entitlement. Here in AmeriKA, bottom feeding cretins take every opportunity available to seize a big screen TV, computer, major appliance, bling or anything of marketable value. Disasters bring out the best and worst in people. Would I loot to feed myself and my family in the face of starvation and civil breakdown with no indication that help is on the way --- you bet.

I honestly can't say what I'd do in that situation as thankfully, I've never been in one similar. However, I can say that PRIOR to such a disaster happening, I prepare, not just for typhoons, but for every imaginable "realistic" scenario. I don't want to be in a position where I'm desperate enough to loot others who took the time/energy TO prepare, whereas I did not. And kudos to the Japanese for their integrity. I'm not exactly convinced it's a cultural thing, desperate people do desperate things no matter what their coordinates are. Whether rich or poor, black or white (or Japanese).

I base my “cultural comments” on the fact that there are two different situations pertaining to "looting." Looting, when your city has been flattened, everyone is homeless, nothing is left standing, everybody is starving is one thing. Looting because someone beat up someone, something like the Travon Martin case happens, or some other "grievance" occurs certainly does not rise to the level of what you see in a disaster.

My point is that there are people who look for an opportunity to loot without regard for the magnitude of a disaster or even the presence of one. When I see someone on a sunny day in the land of opportunity and prosperity and the deluxe safety hammock running out of a store with a big screen TV, the only excuse that comes to mind for me is that it is a cultural thing. Most decent people do not loot other people’s stuff. Period.

Can't argue with that logic. We certainly are the land of "opportunity".

Agreed, the problem in the PI is the disparity between the corrupt gub officials and the average citizen. Remember there is no middle class there. The average Filipino is living almost at a subsistence level already and throw in a super typhoon, it will definitely bring out the worst in people. Its not hard to imagine that we might be headed down this very path.

In terms of Japan, they are a cultural anamoly. I guess it could be their isolationist nature or strong sense of honor/bushido but personally i think they handle their disasters, natural or other wise very well.
