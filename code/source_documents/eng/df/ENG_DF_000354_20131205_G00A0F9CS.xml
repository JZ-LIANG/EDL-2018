A fighter for racial equality against an oppressive government that imprisoned him for 2 decades passed away?

Nobody is perfect, the founding fathers owned slaves, but I still hold them in high regard.

Our best hopes and wishes to our SA preppers, with Mandela gone, this may get tricky.

Why should the passing of another terrorist, reformed or not concern me? I won't disparage him further, but no tears shed here either.

Wife is worried.
Thinks that there may be violence in the streets.
Thinks that certain ANC politicians who threatened "Kill all the whites!" won't have as much holding them back.
Thinks that SA is more likely to "pull a Mugabe" on them.

She's glad she's in the US, and wants to start getting her US citizenship ASAP.

I don't think any one paragraph post on an internet forum can describe Mandela. Some say he was a Marxist, if so, he certainly was no Castro or Stalin. It seems he was more a freedom fighter who used whatever funds and assistance he could get. He did for the most part respect the white's property in the post apartheid era and didn't turn SA into another Zimbabwe. He learned chose to learn Afrikaans willingly which shows he had respect for the Afrikaners. Ruling SA after apartheid was always a high wire act. He never did seem to show extreme bitterness for his incarceration. Watch for Obama to blame his death on the tea party.

Winnie Mandela is an entirely different matter.

Thats the point...... <img src="images/smilies/sleep.gif"/>

We look past their faults to see the greatness they achieved (taking down an oppressive colonial power).

Actually, its a pretty great comparison.

Completely missed his point didn't you... A great man is a man whose many virtues far outweigh his flaws. This is true of a Jefferson as it is true of a Mandela.
