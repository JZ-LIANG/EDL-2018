This is not sounding ideal. What are McCain and Murphy doing? McCain says, "We... want to make it clear to Russia and Vladimir Putin that interference in the affairs of Ukraine is not acceptable to the United States."
WHAT? Have these two dolts heard of the Logan Act? It is illegal for a senator to start Shiite in another country.

Have they not learned from Obama's near miss in Syria?

McCain is a NeoCon, that's a Republican term for Progressive. They love war and are never satisfied unless they're enforcing their will on others. They want to be the world's policemen and they want a police state here. Some see things as left and right and think only folks with a (D) are for larger more powerful government. Not so, there are plenty on both sides of the aisle with this view, he's one of many. Who started WWI? How about WWII? How about Korea and Viet Nam? Who drug us into the sand box? All Progressives, some with a (D) and some with an (R) but one common thread, big government, big spending, Progressives.

They want trouble. Trouble (elsewhere in the world) is good for their corporate masters.

And yet again the very people who used to abuse Bush/Cheney for getting the US into wars is sticking it's nose in yet another country it shouldn't--- Egypt, Libya, Syria, the recent tinkering Obama did when he called up Netanyahu and told him Israel needs to stop building in Judea and Samaria (does Obama want to create a "Palestinian Spring" inside Israel? I think so!!) and now McCain and his nit wit companions sticking their nose into Ukraine-- the whole establishment right now are so freaking stupid. Not a damn one of them understands the concept of "picking your battles wisely".

Yet, they (our government) taze our protesters, not allow them anywhere where there are secret service guys around etc.

Why do we care about protesters in the Ukraine?

I guess because they think now is the perfect time to poke a stick in Russia's eye.

One has to have a signed medical document stating that the bearer is mentally defective in order to hold public office these days.

According to the Federation of American Scientists, "There appear to have been no prosecutions under the Act in its more than 200 year history. However, there have been a number of judicial references to the Act, and it is not uncommon for it to be used as a point of challenge concerning dealings with foreign officials. Although attempts have been made to repeal the Act, it remains law and at least a potential sanction to be used against anyone who without authority interferes in the foreign relations of the United States."

I seriously doubt at this late date they'll start prosecuting.

I'd like us to stay out of the Ukraine's business, too. If the EU wants the Ukraine so badly, let them foot the bill. <img src="http://www.survivalistboards.com/images/smilies/cool.gif"/>

Kiev was the first capital of Russia. This administration needs to stay out of this one.

MtnCat,
I agree. No one is going to jail over this one, but it's a law for a reason. What kind of a mess would we have if Ted Cruz, Harry Reid, and Bernie Sanders all started giving advice (all contrary) to one particular tenuous country? As Americans we know we have a varied representative body...but we don't need to be airing our laundry on foreign ground. At least, it seems, that's what the Logan Act would try to prevent.
