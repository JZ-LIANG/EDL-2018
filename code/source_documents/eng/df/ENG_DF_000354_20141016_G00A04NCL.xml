Word on the wire is that Mein Fuhrer plans to further his step child of safety legislation if he gets re-elected. Glad I am not a full time NY resident anymore.

This doesn't pass the sniff test.
No attribution or documentations.
Released only days before the election.
Attached is an add for Astorino........

An effort to reignite the upstate rage over the NY SAFE ACT perhaps?

It seems possible it could be a campaign ploy, but might also be a pitch for those who support the big C as well. I did some googling on it wen I caught a glance of that article, seems to be a lot of different coverage of the " Safe Act 2". Should be interesting to say the least. Real or not, I wouldn't put it past Cuomo.

Most thought the Safe ACT would never happen here. The assault weapons ban of 1995 and Pataki did enough, right? Then it passed and most were in shock. Then everyone ran to buy 10 round mags and hope they did so quick enough to not become felons. Sell 'evil black rifles' out of state to avoid being arrested, etc etc etc.

Why on earth would we assume that Safe Act Part 2 would be anything but the truth? I honestly feel that the NYS Government is going to do everything it can to make owning firearms so overly expensive that your average citizen simply cannot afford to own one.

Sorry to get heated so quickly, but I simply cannot stand the Safe Act. And I've been to nearly every rally in Albany, whipped out my check book for memberships and donations, and written letters, to ensure my voice is heard.

What's the problem? As soon as you are all disarmed Vermont will invade and annex upstate NY, leaving that hell hole on the Hudson to fend for itself.

I mean, it really makes sense. A lot of crimes are committed with.50 caliber weapons in the United States.

We look at it this way ---- name one politician who is pro-firearm ownership -- pro 2ed. -- and is running on it ---- if Rob looses --- another one will be a very long time coming -- <img src="http://www.survivalistboards.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

Last we heard - there is 21 lawsuits fighting this illegal law -- <img src="http://www.survivalistboards.com/images/smilies/mad.gif"/>

If ass-wipe gets re-elected -- I should resurrect the old "Wagon Train" heading west -- rent a few trucks -- and take families west <img src="images/smilies/thumb.gif"/>

Along with their tax dollars / talents / retirement spending <img src="http://www.survivalistboards.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

I love Astorino's ad. For those of you who are planning to leave NYS, hang on.....

Who is not planning to leave NYS? Everyone is leaving on retirement for sure to one of the golden seven states that don't have income taxes.
