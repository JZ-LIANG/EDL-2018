'Repeal the SAFE Act' signs are on every third lawn around here... and the "Astorino" signs are increasing, too. Now I just hope folks actually get out and vote... it takes a mammoth effort to overpower the NYC free sh!t collective.

Just took a trip to see family in Saratoga this weekend couldn't believe the number of astorino / no safe act signs up everywhere.......though I used to live there and it's a pretty solid repub county, tough to overcome the welfare babies ine the city in statewide elections

"They say I cant win because of all the democrats in NYC" --

( tapping loudly on the mic )

"HELLO -- I'm not running for mayor of NYC" !

Buy your ammo now, because when SAFE II gets jammed through after Commie Cuomo wins, there will be NO buying ammo in the state of NY. Part 2 of the 2nd ammendment violations will require etching on ALL ammo casings sold in NYS. Ammo will become prohibitively expensive in your state or will be nearly unavailable because what manufacturer is going to bother with the additional expense of producing "NY ONLY" bullets?
Stock up now before the price per round is more than gold is per ounce...

That's a great line, too bad it didn't work.
I'm very disappointed Rob didn't win <img src="http://www.survivalistboards.com/images/smilies/frown.gif"/> I've been on the volunteer campaign trail with him since the beginning.. We even went to the same High School.
