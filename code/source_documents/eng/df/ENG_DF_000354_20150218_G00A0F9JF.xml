Lessons from current Conflicts Worldwide

I like to know what goes on in the rest of the world, as whatever happens worldwide, do also have an affect on us, even if indirectly. So I've been keeping a very close eye on the developments in Africa, Ukraine and also the rapid advance of Isis.

Its horrific what is taking place not only in N*i*g*e*r*ia, Libya,Syria &amp; Iraq, but also in Ukraine. What these conflicts have taught me thus far:
Shtf can happen overnight or within hours, where you literally have to run for your life with only the clothing on your back - So its prudent to have a place close to your home where you can hide, even if its a pre-dug hole in the ground, a mini-bol if you will, were you can stay for a short while, cause if u hv an hour or less to get out of dodge, there is no way you will be able to get out by car nor will you get very far on foot. Maybe a good idea to have a bug out bag and weapons stashed there too. There is no such thing as a friend or a friendly neighbor - When shtf, your best friend or nice neighbor will turn on you or turn you in. - Therefore imo, its best to keep your prepping activities on the low down and trust nobody. Cash Money - During a major shtf situation, you are going to need lots of cash to grease palms to buy your safety and that of your family if need be,to get from point A-B and/or to pay premium price for whatever scarce items are available. - Time for me to start stashing a little bit of money each month in a coffee tin or something I think. Gold and silver will be also nice of course, but for now, I can't afford to buy gold or silver, so money will have to do. Bunkers /Basements - Currently in Ukraine, bunkers/basements have saved many lives. Many homes in the towns which were/are under attack, have basements. Admittedly many also died inside them. But at least it has given some people a place to hide, even if its only temporary. - So imo a bunker/basement is a must. Food, Water &amp; Medicines,weapons &amp; clothing -We all know this one - We simply can't slack down with prepping as overnight we can be in the same position as the people in other conflict areas. Village, Farm or City - Risk Seems to be more in remote areas- From current N*i*g*e*r*i*a, Isis conflict and in Ukraine, it seems that villages and farms are major targets, with very low - no survival rate, whereas in cities, survival rate is a bit higher,but conditions are horrific where there is full scale war in the cities. - So imo unless you are already somewhere in the middle of nowhere, preferably in a mountainous area, when shtf and have a very well hidden and well stocked bug out spot, you are screwed.
What else do you guys think we can learn from current conflicts worldwide?
Eg ISIS, Ukraine, Boko Haram etc?

How can you not afford silver? Have you seen the prices?

Your hole in ground is a good way station. Nature reserves are where your grond gat should be. Suikerbos to the south for eg.

Under the cover of hiking go dig a hole.

You wanna grease palms? Grease them with Peter Styvesants..... And a box of Lion matches. Every ukranian and his dog had a ciggy in his mouth.

Are you going to abandon your car ? Or will the hole in ground be big enough for your car too ?

Neighbours and co workers suck. They treat you like a registered american sex offender for being a registered gun owner. So stuff em... I have learned my lesson... I have every intention of exploiting their misery if that day comes.

Bunker is a tomb for me. Unless there is an escape hatch.

Fred will weigh in soon with his SL stuff <img src="http://www.survivalistboards.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>
