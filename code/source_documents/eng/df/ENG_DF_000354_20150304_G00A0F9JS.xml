Crossing borders

Seeing that there are some dedicated new threads today, thanks Enigma <img src="images/smilies/thumb.gif"/>, there is something that just seems to be missing. I have read so many posts on bugging in/bugging out, large groups/small groups, urban options/rural options, big guns/little guns, shelters, food storage and so much more.

Something missing for me, perhaps I have overlooked the thread? I would love to hear some of your guys and gals opinions on crossing the border to Namibia/Mozambique/Botswana? Pros or Cons?

Great thread! It opens up a whole new dimension of possibilities. I've travelled and lived in Europe and Asia, but never in the rest of Africa! Always been a dream to do that one day when I'm at retirement age.

So I am not really qualified to answer your question, since I have not lived in the countries you mentioned, but if I'd venture an educated guess, I'd say it will be safer to cross over into Namibia or Botswana, depending where you are currently located in SA.

I think it depens on the level of poverty in the countries mentioned, land issues there and biased political affiliations that their governments have with SA government.

Mozambique, is still too unstable, with Renamo flare-ups, so influx of people over the border, will cause resentment amongst locals. Also, you can't own land in Moz if u not a citizen, you have to lease, if I am not mistaken (I stand to be corrected).
Botswana has lots of empty spaces, so may be a good option, plus one of the safest countries in africa I think (I stand to be corrected)
Namibia may be a good option, as it seems to be the stable, but there was recent land claim issues or something to that affect, a while ago, so resentment brewing there. Land reform is implemented there, similar to SA. Not sure about land ownership, but think its allowed.

So I think my choice will be Botswana

If the SHTF in a big way in SA, and if it is a quick (almost overnight) descent into chaos... then I suspect that many of out neighbours would simply close their borders pretty quickly. None of them, that I am aware of, are equipped to handle an influx of refugees on the sort of scale that I suspect would happen (millions). They do not have the money nor the infrastructure to accommodate those refugees. I also suspect that Zim would not want their "runners" heading back to their own country either.

Yip I think Nunu is right. If its an overnight shtf situation, those countries will most probably close borders. If there is advanced warning however, it may be worthwhile for some people who are planning to bug out and who currently live in close proximity to these borders, to establish a nice secondary hidden Bol, just over the fence so to speak, just in case its needed.

In a race-based civil war, do you mean?

I decided a long time ago that that would not be an option for me because in a full-scale conflagration the ANC's historical blood brothers would be very quick to side with them against their (mutual) historical foes.

On a few occasions I have been in ANC company in Botswana, Angola, and elsewhere, and I have been struck by just how deep the bonds of allegiance run, and how fresh and acute are the sentiments about the wars of liberation. I don't want to have to write out an essay, but I assure you that it is not beyond the realms of reality to say that - were the circumstances severe enough - Namibia, Botswana, and others would inter white South Africans.

You lose your guns if you cross the border.

Thanks for the feedback everyone.

With regards to Namibia, there is still strong German presence, if they rejected us whites and the white German influence made a noise, what do you think will be the chances of Aunty Merkel and clan throwing in a wee bit of "influence"?

You should read the SvR story. He has quite a bit to say about our civil war, the Germans, and Namibia. I don't want to give the game away, but if you are thinking along those lines then you really should read what Siener has to say about your exact topic above. You'll be knocked off your feet.
