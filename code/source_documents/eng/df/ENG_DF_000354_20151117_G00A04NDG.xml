So our illustrious governor supports the admittance of Syrian immigrants into NY with no way to screen them, but tracks his own citizen's gun purchases to the 10th degree. Gee, who side is he on anyway? Let's let in potential terrorists while restricting legal, tax paying citizens from purchasing guns he deems as dangerous. Hard to believe people voted for this piece of crap when he is invalidating one of the key duties of gov't., protecting the citizens.

You have a real governor we have a liberal crap bucket. And you're right, upstate NY voted against him but we don't have enough people between us and like minded people downstate to overcome the mindless hoards.
