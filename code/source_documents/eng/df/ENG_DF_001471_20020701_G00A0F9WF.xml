How long do you think Steve Jobs will remain at apple for? I really have no idea but i think he'll stay for a long time to come... also who will take over if jobs does leave?

Wow, I never thought of that. Interesting topic, though. Who would take over? How is Jobs gonna leave? Being fired? Or just resigning.... wow.... cool topic

He will probably stay untill he is 65. After that, I'm going to be running apple. <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":D"/>

thats one issue that scares the analysts...who is being groomed to take over if steve leaves(unlikely) or if something unexpected occurs.

he does have that one english designer(can't remember his name) that i've read about...he sounds brilliant and well equipped from a philosophical standpoint...but steve IS apple and apple IS steve so his departure will undoubtably cause waves.

regardless, i don't see any big changes happening up top for apple anytime soon...everything is going too well.

Jonathan Ive(s?) is the name you're after. I don't know who would run Apple if Jobs left.. it would probably fall to an oligarchal approach I suspect.. I don't think any of the other top brass at Apple really has the presence to take over the showman aspect. Phil Schiller is not a bad person, nor is Mr. Tevanian (whose name I have probably butchered, sorry) but I don't think they have the flair. Maybe we can kidnap Larry Ellison and have him take over. Personally, I am just hoping Jobs lives another 75 years and keeps things at Apple on track for 50 of those.

You whore. Just digging for some heat on this one aren't you? <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=";)"/>

No, I'd have to say that a post-Steve Apple would be a very different company indeed. Who's to say that Jon Ive wouldn't be the PERFECT CEO for a 21st century Apple. Think about it. Apple has become a more and more friendly company, and its design has really pushed that notion. Who is responsible for that design? Jonathan Ive. I can see it now. An incredibly hip, young British designer with an uncanny knack for truly revolutionary organic design at the helm of the world's first digital hub provider. It's an organic concept, and he'd be perfect to pitch it. He's not overbearing, but very eloquent. He has an undeniably likeable presence, and he's bloody brilliant. And he'd still have Phil and Avi and the rest of the crew there to help out. Ive would just become the face man. What do you think?

I can't imagine an Apple without Steve Jobs... It seems like Jobs is the only one who can successful run Apple.

I see Apple moving more into the entertainment and consumer electronics market, a la Sony, in the next 10 years. Apple may be unrecognizable to us 15 years from now. So maybe, we'll see someone from Sony or Disney take over, someone with broader appeal and background than guys like Tevian or Ives.

Wait for Bill Gates Jr...

You heard that father won't be leaving the billions to the kids, it might prove the incentive for the kid to jump ship and crush MS from Apple's high office.

Heh. Good one, Sun Baked.

No, I don't see why Tevian or Ive wouldn't be the PERFECT guy for a more Sony-like Apple. They both fundamentally understand and wholly believe in the digital hub strategy. Moreover, they're both incredibly media-friendly in terms of presentation. Nobody is more qualified to sell the "whole widget" more than these two guys. I personally don't see Apple bringing in outside talent again. It hasn't exactly worked well for them in the past. Better to stick with someone from the inside who knows the program.
