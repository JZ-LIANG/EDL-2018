Not that DotMusic - as a potential iTunes Music Store competitor, when iTMS comes to Europe - has any axe to grind, of course...

man...i love the beatles more than a lot of things, but this is just ridiculous. apple records doesn't have nearly the name recognition as The Beatles does...they should let it drop.

Apple records pulled this stunt when Apple computer was first created. they reached an agreement that apple computer could use the name as long as they never produced audio/music equipment. when the first macs with microphones shipped, they included the "sosumi" sound.

Apple records needs to give it a rest. i didn't even know it was around any more. they should be looking forward to the publicity they'll get when people accidentally stop by their site instead of apple.com, or perhaps that's the entire motive behind this move...

I think Steve Jobs should buy Apple Records and, while he's at it, Michael Jackson's rights to the Beatle's catalog. I'll chip in a dollar, Steve.

Love the Beatles, but I must say that I'm a little tired of these antics. Nobody cares about the name, Apple Records. They care about the studio at Abbey Lane.

now that would be something if SJ ewre to go to MJ's house to negotiate for the rights to the beatles songs, but wouldn't having the rights to the beatles songs make the beatles even more pissed?

I don't get the big deal. Apple Computers and Apple Records are different names. Just like Sony and Sony Ericsson.

Sony Ericsson

Not quite the same thing...

Err... Sony Ericsson is a joint venture between Sony and Ericsson - Apple Records has no connection with Apple Computer.

I believe Apple Corp is primarilly owned by Michael Jackson (the pop star artist) and Sony Records. Both are on record as strong supporters of Apple Computer Inc generallly and iPod, iTunes and computers specifically.

As such this is more an issue of dealing with a lisencing modification to a long standing contract and dealing with how to deal with the unexpected shift of Apple Computer Inc into music distribution proper, which I am sure neither party expected on day one of this contract.

Apple Corp is effectively a single product company (like a movie company often is) while Apple Computer Inc is a multi-product, multi-industry company.

I bet the end result is the new contract adds 10-30 cents per iPod to Apple Computer Inc's licensing cost to Apple Corp to address this unforseen issue.

When one can afford a G5 dual 2 ghz, one lives on Abbey Lane NOT Abbey Road <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":p"/>

BTW, no one commented on the last line of the rumor?

I think they can certainly sue again because Apple Computer has breached the contract again. I'm sure both parties have been negotiating for several months.

You are wrong, they can sue again.

Apple has entered into a new business line, in the music industry. Which they had formerly agreed to stay out of.

So, I smell some type of settlement with Apple Records.
