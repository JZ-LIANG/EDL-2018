<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,97064,00.html">A Fox News column reports</a> that The Beatles (Apple Corps) are suing Apple Computer over their move into the music arena with the iPod and iTunes Music Store.

Apple Computer and Apple Corps are not strangers and, in fact, have had previous legal settlements over corporate name confusion. In earlier agreements, Apple Computer had agreed to not enter the music industry, and had reportedly paid out a large settlement to Apple Corps.

According to this column, Apple was served legal papers over the past few days over breach of contract.

Frivilous / Malicious

Apple needs to countersue this time around for frivilous malicious intent and libel - the other 2 suits had NOTHING to do with ANY Beatles copyright

Well I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.

I first heard about this when the iTunes Music Store first came out, so it's not a new topic. I think it's silly that they would sue, especially since Apple isn't MAKING music, just selling it. Anyway, I hope they don't have to pay fat fines, or whatever, to Apple Company (Music, Studios... whatever it's called).

i honestly think they will not win this case. the riaa loves apple as well as most of the recording industry. plus they should have sued apple back in the early sytem days in they encorparated sound in the system.

Maybe they should take this opportunity to do business with Apple, because if I recall correctly, the Beatles are not included in the iTMS.

...simplest solution?
BUY APPLE RECORDS!

A little Microsoftian, but it'll get the job done.
...and if Michael Jackson is looking to sell his ranch, I'm sure Apple could make a deal to buy him out too.
Beatles music rights, and thousands of dollars worth of plastic and new noses!

Well, this is interesting. Can't say I blame them. I get confused between pop supergroups and computers all the time.

The Beatles SUCK!

Screw the Beatles. I can't believe that these egotistical morons would sue Apple over this; I mean, it was a compliment for Jobs to name his company in this way. Talk to the hand! <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":mad:"/>

come on already...i can't believe apple agreed to that to begin with. i think they could've successfully argued that apple computers and apple records would not be confused by the public. what the hell does apple records even do anymore??

I ME MINE

Although I'm a huge Beatles fan, I think it's ridiculous for Apple Corps to bring this suit against Apple Computer. In the early 70s, YES ("if you use 'Apple' then don't go into the Music business") -- that's when it was the very real possibility that Apple Corps would actually be some sort of publishing force themselves for other bands besides themselves.

It's 2003 -- Apple Corps has only ever really been about the Beatles... it never really tried to represent and push other acts forward. If you read anything about Apple Corps and the Beatles, you find that they initially had a big beautiful dream that died quickly (even before they themselves disbanded)...

Why push Apple Computers around now?

OH-Oh <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":confused:"/> I think Apple Computer will win this not Apple Reords. Maybe Apple Computer will make a deal With Apple Records. $$$ For both of them. Oh well

Apple did ask for it:

When Apple Computers first came into existence, the Beatles' lawyers_sued -- and won -- over the use of the corporate name. The Fab Four, it_was_widely known, already had their own_company called_Apple Corps. (Ironically, Jobs admitted to naming his company as a tribute to the Beatles.) The result of the suit was a huge cash settlement and a promise that the Apple logo and name would only be used for computers -- and_never for a music company.

Several years later, when computers starting having music come through attachable speakers, the Beatles again sued_and won, this time_over breach of a trademark agreement since Apple Computers had agreed to steer clear of the music business. Their winnings against Apple Computers have come to an estimated_$50 million so far.

Knew this was coming...

I can remember way back when the RUMORS of the ITMS started, people were talking about Apple's promise to stay out of the music industry...

Should be very interesting to see what happens.
