<a href="http://www.nypost.com/business/20309.htm">The New York Post claims</a> that the five major record labels have been in negotiations with Apple over pricing as well as other issues surrounding Apple's onling music store (iTunes).

Under the new contracts, the most popular singles could rise to $1.25 according to the Post's sources.

<a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2004/05/20040504072403.shtml">During the iTunes conference call</a>, Steve Jobs addressed the question of album pricing:

<quote>
But in any event, most of the albums on iTunes are priced at $9.99 and below and, no, they're not creeping up. There's always a few that are a little higher than you can go in and pull out, but they're very, very competitive and we see in the future the prices of the albums coming down, not going up, because that's what it's going to take to sell more albums and it's in everybody's best interest to do so.

This must be a joke....I guarantee you will see a decrease in downloads on iTMS and a HUGE jump on LimeWire activity.

This would be the WORST thing the music industry can do. As is, Apple only gets what, 20 cents on the dollar..and they do most of the work. Jobs needs to make a stand.

why does Apple have to sell them for more, yet Walmart gets away with selling songs at 88 cents each.

Well if it goes to $1.25, I'm not going to be using the service anymore.

Just goes to show how out of touch the industry is with its customers. They have FINALLY found a way to get a large number of people to quit using P2P and buy their music legally-- and so they decide to kill it by raising prices.

Killing a Good Thing

And the RIAA wonders why sales are off. No such thing as market price in the entertainment industry it seems.

Consider source

This is the same NY Post that said Avie Tevanian was on the verge of bolting. Last I checked he was still with Apple.

Still, you gotta hope the record labels aren't that dumb. Album prices are already going too high for online distribution on iTunes.

It will only hurt Apple if it's selling singles for $1.25 while Wal-Mart, Napster, Sony and others are under the magic $1 mark.

Because Wal-Mart, in typical fashion, probably made threats to the labels. "If you don't let us sell songs for 88 cents, we won't stock your label's CDs in our stores."

you know its just a matter of time before it will happen - although I have to say its way too soon - the whole industry is just getting up and running and a price hike, no matter how small, will shoot it in it's foot....

So if the price of single songs goes up, will the price of albums go up? Songs going up to $1.25 doesn't bother me that much since most of the time, I buy whole albums. However, if the price of an album goes up, buying music on the iTMS will definitely be less advantageous. I won't pay $12 for downloading an album when I could buy it online or in some music stores for not much more.

Good point. There's a magic price point, where people are willing to give up features (liner notes, a physical CD) for price. The closer a download price gets to the physical CD's price, the fewer online sales they'll get.
