Apple &amp; Apple Corps Settlement?
</headline>
<post author="MacRumors" datetime="2004-09-13T11:35:00" id="p1">
According to <a href="http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=upsell_article&amp;articleID=VR1117910305&amp;categoryID=16&amp;cs=1">Daily Variety</a> (subscription required) in a story also picked up by <a href="http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/apple_vs_beatles.html">Ultimate-Guitar.com</a>, Apple Computer and Apple Corps are on the verge of announcing a huge settlement in their ongoing trademark dispute, one that could "massively dwarf the $26.5 million paid to the Fab Four's company in 1991 in a row over trademark use."

A lawyer was quoted in these stories as opining, "People are expecting this to be the biggest settlement anywhere in legal history, outside of a class action suit. The numbers could be mind boggling." The name of this lawyer wasn't disclosed, nor how he would be in possession of inside knowledge of the alleged impending settlement.

There is a possibility that Apple Corps may become a large shareholder in Apple Computer, a result which might bring former Beatle Paul McCartney to the Apple board of directors.

I think an obvious question raised by this is 'is the Beatles catalog going to be available on iTMS or not?'

Wow. I wondered where this lawsuit went

I'm not sure where I stand on all of this, but it would be nice to get a roadblock out of Apple's way, and let them get some good news, good buzz, and keep making great products.

If Paul was on the board, Apple would continue to gain street cred, and continue to rock ;-)

I dunno.. I just hope the numbers in this aren't as big as I'm thinking they'll be.. If they're not, everything's great, and we get Beatles on iTMS (probably).

If they are.. We'll see.

It's a European company that's filing the suit, and the legal proceedings are being held in Europe.

Guys, you do know that there is an aggreement with the two companies agreeing that Apple UK wouldn't make computers and Apple US wouldn't sell music, right? Apple US does owe money. But it'll be settled, Apple US does owe money to Apple UK.

ummm... as to talentless I'm going to let his sales speak to that, on the other topic:

Apple is clearly in violation of their agreement, its a legal fact. They brokered a deal whereby they would not enter the music arena with their similar name, they have done that and then are bound by the agreement. The Beatles had the name first and Apple computer has to pay to use it, what is the problem?
