You know what's really funny? You can go out onto the streets today and ask them about "Apple Music", and absolutely nobody will remember who they even were! All these unexpiring intellectual property/trademark nonsense really has to end <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":mad:"/>

Steve Jobs probably won't do that.

Considering that man takes no **** from anybody, let alone a now defunct record company <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

You know what really grinds my gears. The Beatles weren't even good. There, I said it, and I feel much better now. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills since everyone seems to disagree, but I can safely say I don't like any of their tunes. <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":("/>

In case you didn't pick up on it, I think this case is completely unjustified.

Okay, I'm gonna get outta this thread before y'all bite my head off and spit it back out onto the keyboard. I'm not even talking about the thing on my shoulders.

I wouldn't know about "Apple Music" if not for this lawsuit. What a frackin' waste of time.

How can someone sue twice? I thought they already sued last year. Does Apple Legal just ignore them? I wish the Apple Music company would get caught with distributing Keynotes, installing Tiger on a Dell, or discuss detailed information on future products aftering signing a waiver not to discuss it. Then Apple could sue them.

No new case here. This is simply last years case that has finally come round to a hearing in court. Unless of course someone finally decides to back down at the last minute. The English legal system can take a long time to work. Whatever the outcome, I'm sure there will be a lot of press.

From my understanding Apple actually signed an agreement with "Apple" (the music company) explicitly stating that they would not use the trademark in the music related business. Apple (the computer company) subsequently infringed on the agreement. I don't see how Apple (the computer company) is not at fault here since they signed the agreement in the first place.

Having said that this case will be settled with some "mula".

thank you!!! finally, someone who agrees with me! They weren't good in the 60's, and they sure as hell aren't good now. Time for these fossils and their defunct company to go away.

What does your opinion on how good or bad "The Beatles" were as a band have any bearing on this court case? I'd like to point out that you are in a clear minority as far as your opinion goes, however, despite that, it still does not admonish the fact that this was an agreement between the two companies and Apple has infringed on that agreement.

I am fan of Apple and it's innovations, however, being blind to the obvious facts does not do you any justice.
