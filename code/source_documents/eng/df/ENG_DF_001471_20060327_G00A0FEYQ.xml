Avie Tevanian Leaving Apple?
</headline>
<post author="MacRumors" datetime="2006-03-27T21:03:00" id="p1">
<a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/indexn?blogid=19">A SFGate blog reports</a> that Apple has confirmed that Avie Tevanian will be leaving Apple at the end of March to "pursue other interests".

Avie Tevanian currently holds the position of <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/tevanian.html">Chief Software Technology Officer at Apple</a> and was previously the vice president of Engineering at NeXT. Tevanian was one of the principal designers and engineers of the Mach operating system on which NEXTSTEP and subsequently Mac OS X were based.

Tevanian had previously been rumored to have been leaving Apple in 2001.

So what, now that the OS X transition is complete, there's no need for Avie? I wonder if this is a good move, or a bad move.

Fishes,

Saw this a bit earlier...a brilliant mind. Apple will be hard-pressed to find another visionary like Avie to lead OS development going forward. Obviously a lot of balls are already rolling and will keep users happy for a while, but they need someone to develop a cohesive plan for the future of the Mac OS.

But then again, maybe some new blood will lead to radical new ideas that could turn out great for users.

Not Avie! Not now! Not like this! He and Ive are the only good looking blokes at Apple.

He'll be missed

No one person is the center of the company....Even dare I say Steve Jobs <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":eek:"/>

None the less he was certainly a key leader in the compnay. <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":("/>

With Avie gone, could we see the possiblity of a Linux based Mac OS in the future? Could get interesting.

Not Rubenstein?

I wonder if this reporter got the wrong name? We already know <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/12904672.htm">Rubenstein is leaving</a> on March 31st.

Actually, his title was chief software technology officer, and from everything Ive heard, he hasnt really been much involved with Apples software since he <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2003/07/the_good_the_bad_and_the_avie">took that position almost three years ago</a>. Still, without question, Tevanian has been hugely influential in the development and design of Mac OS X.

Short the stock! Maybe. I dunno. I do remember when HP's Fionna (sp) left and the stock went up a couple of million dollars. Must feel good when your departure causes the company to increase in value 10%.

About time...

Maybe now they'll finally be able to ditch the frickin Mach microkernel piece of crap, that Nazi Tevanian has been adamant must be a part of the OS even though it's a performance pit, all because it's his PhD project. He's no visionary, just a reasonably smart hardass who happened to be at the right place at the right time and profited handsomely for it. Watch OSX improve by leaps and bounds as the old guard finally gets kicked out. A bunch of these NeXT alumni seriously have their heads up their collective arses.

Repeat of 2001 rumor?

Go, don't go...I don't know who you are in the first place.

In fact, the monolithical kernel structure is old and obsolete and the only OS that uses it is Linux....well, there are certain Linux distros that use microkernel too!...

As you see, most modern OS use microkernels, for various reasons. I invite you to take a look at the BeOS development, QNX development (there are even some nuclear plants that works in an environment based in QNX) and other "modern" Operating Systems (I mean modern by using new concepts of kernel, not the 80s monolithical kernel) and you will know what i'm talking about.

Regards. ^^

Well, I guess his leaving plays into the notion that Apple is moving from the Mac OS being based on Mach to being based on Windows.

Pretty wild.
