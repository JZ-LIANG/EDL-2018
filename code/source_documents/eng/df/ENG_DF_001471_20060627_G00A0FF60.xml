iPod Factory Conditions Update
</headline>
<post author="MacRumors" datetime="2006-06-27T12:59:00" id="p1">
The Mac web is buzzing with a report yesterday by <a href="http://www.chinacsr.com/2006/06/26/foxconn-admits-breaking-labor-laws-in-china/">ChinaCSR</a>, a corporate social responsibility website focused on China, which claimed that iPod manufacturer Foxconn had admitted that their employees work about 80 extra hours each month, which is 44 hours over the maximum 36 hours overtime work allowed in Chinese law. The site also claimed that Apple's special investigatory team had signed off on the factory conditions, apparently even after the <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2006/06/20060614153017.shtml">news broke</a>.

Despite many sites having run the story ( AppleInsider, Engadget, Inquirer, etc ), it appears that ChinaCSR is the only and original source for the story. MacRumors cannot independently confirm the story's contents, and given its brevity and lack of supporting quotations, we have some doubts about some of the assertions made (although we cannot rule out its accuracy either).

Last week, Foxconn <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/systems/a20060619A2007.html">denied claims</a> that it was running an 'iPod sweatshop' in its factories in China. Apple has sent a team to investigate the conditions but has not officially reported any findings.

I am with Macrumors on the feelings behind this, it would be nice to see pictures or get some quotes from people involved in this.

Foxconn could do itself good by doing an official statement with regards to this report, as opposed to the tight lipped no comment approach.

::EDIT::

It appears Foxconn has an official statement.

<quote orig_author="Report">
Edmund Ding, spokesman for Foxconn -- a chief maker of iPods -- said there were huge discrepancies between the truth and the claims in the report, which he said seems like a vicious attack on the company. He added that the company reserves the right to take legal actions over the report.

Was the asian spokesperson here chosen on purpose to represent foxconn for PR reasons?

Thank you

With great power comes great responsibility

MacRumors.com has great power these days amongst the Mac Web... I applaud them for having the courage to post a truthful (and doubtful) eye on this story which has seemed like it was concocted by Apple's competition from the beginning.

It's a plea always hopeless in the face of frantic impatience: but, without relieving any of the pressure for these companies to do the right thing out of this situation, it might be an idea to wait for an official, corroborated statement.

but hours are set by province, not by central government...

i thought the hours worked in Foxconn didn't actually go over the province's limits....?

We have to find out about this. But then most, if not all products we receive are built in places where labour is very, very cheap. What to do? I think Apple should answer at least....
