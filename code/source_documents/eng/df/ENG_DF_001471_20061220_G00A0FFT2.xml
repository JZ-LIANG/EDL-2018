Cliff notes:

Bush wants to enlarge the size of Army and Marines.
Says "all options are on the table" to do this.

I personally think its only a matter of time until it does happen. How does Bush expect to continue his wars in the Middle East? We can't keep these 18 month rotations of our troops going forever. All of our Guard and Reservists are already on active duty...where else do we pull from?

A lot of you might say this would be political suicide to do this, not only for Bush but for the Republican party but what other option does he have to attempt to do something in the Middle East. Especially with our build up of Navy forces to show a military strength in the Persian Gulf against Iran. If a draft doesn't happen now all it will take is one more domestic terrorist attack, or the involvement of Iran in some type of war.

Mhh, I don't think a draft is in the works. It's not exactly the most popular option the president could take, and I doubt he would want to further damage his reputation when he's already so disliked. He's got a legacy to build, remember? I doubt he wants to be remembered as the president who supported an unpopular war with an even more unpopular draft late in his second term, where any draft instituted would likely be revoked by an incoming president anyway.

Granted, this would be a political decision, but I'm in the Army and there are probably a total of three people in the entire US military who are in favor of a draft.

So, absent a world war, I'd say you're pretty safe.

No, don't worry, it won't happen. No one would support it.

If there was a draft, I would immediately drop what I was doing and protest at the capitol. I think there would be a huge amount of outrage for drafting people to an abysmal war that was started on lies.

We would leave Iraq a smoldering crater before we would institute a draft.

Is this true apart from WW1 and WW2? Limited, unsuccessful engagements probably don't, cf. Suez, VietNam, Boer War, Iraq.

During the 2004 election campaign John Kerry put forward the idea of the need to expand the military along with concentrating on building up certain critical functions. Now, two and a half years later of saying everything was fine with the US military and Iraq on the verge of total collapse, Bush uses this idea for cover to accomplish something it was never meant to do - keep us in Iraq. If the greater numbers were even the answer to Iraq, they won't be on line until 2008. In the meantime we shall continue the same insanity with a policy that every knowledgeable military source says is going to "break" our military. The man is crazy.

Since news has reports of the branches hitting their recruiting goals lately, perhaps the branches could get allowed (and funded) to increase their recruiting?
