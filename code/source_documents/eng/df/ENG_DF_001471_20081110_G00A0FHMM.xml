Barack Obama will move swiftly to close Guantanamo Bay as soon as he takes office, his aides revealed today, a clear and early sign of how aggressively he wants to break with President Bush the moment he is sworn in.

Well, this is certainly good news. <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":D"/>

Thank God! Maybe they'll even get trials. It's about damn time.

Sounds good, it's about time America starts acting like a grown up nation again.

He is looking at creating a new "terrorism court" on the US mainland to try up to 80 terror suspects, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-confessed September 11 mastermind. Mr Obama said last week that he would close the prison "as quickly as we can do prudently".

I'm really happy already with Obama. Hope he keeps this up!

Yeah... Obama's victory kind of feels like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q1ohONusS8">this</a>.

Considering how this is a shameful mark on American's history, it should be one of the first things to go.

Let's hope sending people to get tortured in other countries follows suit.

There is going to be times where we look at him and think 'eek - I wouldn't have done that' or 'he hasn't changed that' but we need to put these things into perspective when they happen.

With that said... so am I.

Brilliant news. This will do more to fight the "War on Terror" than anything Bush/Cheney have done since this camp was set up. The US can start rebuilding the bridges that have been destroyed over the past eight years and genuinely win hearts and minds instead of chasing people into the arms of extremists.

Starting to look like the history of the USA between 2000 and 2016 will be summed up by the phrase Shock and Awe. Quite ironic really <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":D"/>

I hope he's got a plan for dealing with the detainees who aren't going to be charged but can't be sent home.

I think that will be one of the biggest challenges. Do we let China have them cause it thinks they are guilty for example?

If they are innocent and just got caught up because of $$ bounties, do we allow them to stay in the US if communities offer to help them integrate?

Why couldn't they be sent home?

Because some of their former home countries won't allow them to return.

There could be personal safety issues if some of them are sent home. There could be situations where their lives could be in jeopardy.

The article says that their home country does not want them back. But this is what confuses me. If they are proven innocent, why doesnt the country have them back? <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":confused:"/>

EDIT: Nvm, the poster above me answered it I guess.

Not "our" problem.

There's a difference between proven innocent and not charged with anything. If for example a prisoner is in Guantanamo because he fought with the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Afghan government is probably not going to permit their readmission to the country after their release. I expect the same would be true of Saudi nationals. This could be a sticky problem.
