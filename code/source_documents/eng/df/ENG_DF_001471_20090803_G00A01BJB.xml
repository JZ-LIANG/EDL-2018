Iran does a low-key confirmation of Ahmadinejad amid no-shows and dissent

Wow. Iran is really trying to keep a lid on all those little cracks in the monolithic image of a smooth re-election of their president.

Today the top cleric confirmed Ahmadinejad as president, but kinda stiff-armed the guy during the ceremony (message: no photos of you kissing my hand or hugging me this time, pal) and Iranian TV didn't telecast it live or even tell people when the ceremony would start. Plus assorted important leaders and former leaders didn't even show up!

No wonder Khamenei kept the guy at arm's length; he has to hedge his bets now with turmoil in the streets continuing to erupt and divisions in the clergy appearing to harden. I wonder how the swearing in at the parliament will go on Wednesday...

Here's the bottom line from the piece:

Unlike in 2005, viewers were not told when the ceremony would start, and it was not broadcast live, perhaps to avoid highlighting the number of eyebrow-raising no-shows, which included opposition leader Mousavi, a former prime minister; two former presidents; the head of a religious foundation; two former speakers of parliament; a former national security advisor; and numerous clergy and lawmakers.

Another piece, in the Washington Post, noted that the grandson of Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Iranian revolution, was conveniently off visiting somewhere in Pakistan upon this occasion, and that other Khomeini relatives also took a pass on the confirmation event. I find that quite interesting.
