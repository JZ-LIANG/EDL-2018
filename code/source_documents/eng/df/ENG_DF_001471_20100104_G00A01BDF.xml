It's amazing these things are still operational six years on.

A testament to some seriously talented people at NASA. These things weren't supposed to last a year.

These two little robots are a testament to man kind. They will almost certainly last longer than we will! NASA will be wise to use these rovers as a guide to explore the rest of the universe.

Agreed, truly an incredible job by all who have worked on the project.

I never understood the wheel design, but they made it work with typical NASA complexity. They should have put on fake sexual organs to confuse the aliens.

I'm a big science nerd, even though I was never good at math. I love that stuff. I could never even begin to fathom how it's done, but I find space exploration and physics insanely interesting.

I'm the same way. My dad has the masters in physics, and has done the math. My sister's the geologist.

I'm good at computers and other things, but science isn't any of them.

But I love seeing every new shot from Hubble, the launches, etc.

Have you seen a shuttle launch? I got lucky enough to go see one like 6 years ago or so. It was the same week as they flew two shuttles back to Florida piggybacked in the same day.

I lived in the Orlando area and went and saw STS-67 launch at 1:38 am EST. It was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.

I was able to see the smoke trails from most launches from my home providing that there wasn't too much cloud cover. I also heard the twin sonic booms as the shuttles were returning to the Kennedy Space Center.
