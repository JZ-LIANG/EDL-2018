It has been 50 years since that historic challenge.
What next?

I don't know what's next, but it seems Mars is currently the hot topic of space exploration. Personally, I'd like to see us return to the moon, and start some type of research station, colony or something there.

I really liked that speech by JFK too. He challenged us to do the tough things, not the easy things and because of that, we accomplished many great things.

Undoubtedly, but let's not forget that this was during the depths of the Cold War and about one-upmanship over the Russians who had been first to make many achievements - first satellite, first man in space, first spacewalk, etc and being first on the moon would trump the Russians

There is no competition to drive that innovation any more <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":("/>

Very true. But I wish we could say that our desire for knowledge would be enough for that level of exploration, rather than another cold war pushing us.

Agreed. Especially as there is no need any longer for one nation to bear the cost alone. This is something that could drive technological innovation for the whole world, while still harking back to Armstrong's "One giant leap for mankind"

You're right, however, there is a part of me as an American that still wants to see the US lead the way on our own, and not do joint ventures. Right, wrong or indifferent, there's no doubt my feeling is a pride thing.

Then you have to argue with multiple nations over who pays for what, what the objectives will be, where to launch, which nation the astronauts come from, and so forth. It'd just make a difficult mission even more difficult.

In the end the US would probably end up paying for most of it as usual. So why not do it all and not deal with all the international politicking? It would be of better benefit to the US as all the tech they came up with would be patented to US companies.

Sure it's expensive but not too expensive. The estimates I read indicate that five to eleven manned missions could be launched for the cost of the Iraq war. That cost could be recouped by the economy. If the companies paid to design new technologies were required to manufacture any patented device or material in the US for the duration of the patent, as a stipulation in the contract bidding process.

The International Space Station is a good example of international cooperation. Astronauts from multiple countries, including Americans being lifted to the ISS on Russian rockets.

The threats we face - as a planet - are now global in nature. The solutions we develop, including space exploration, should also be global. We should have been well past the point where national pride takes precedence over what is good for the planet.
