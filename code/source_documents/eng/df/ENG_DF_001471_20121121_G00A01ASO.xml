-Curiosity chief scientist John Grotzinger

The guys at Caltech/JPL have some interesting data coming in from Curiosity's SAM (Sample Analysis at Mars) interment. Curiosity can not directly conform the presence of life on mars. However the SAM module can see if the building blocks for life are out there.
Now all there is to do is to wait till the scientists can recheck their work and publish it. Its going to be an interesting few weeks.

They won't announce it until Dec 3. Freakin teases!
NASA said it's gonna be a 'historic' announcement. Meaning they found evidence that there was life at one point on Mars. Curiosity landed in a spot where water used to flow, so there are (or should be) signs that life existed once. They found those carbon-based molecules they were hoping to find.
Finally, we'll have hard evidence that life exists beyond Earth. (Duh, of course.)

Nasa wants to keep us guessing. Maybe they found Jimmy Hoffa...

It's OK everyone, false alarm. It was just my keys. NASA decoded TB Vets ID# and called me this morning. They say however it will be awhile before they can get the keys back to me.

Nothing really; just an "historical mission" in total... But hey, I see it as an investment into our future so it's fine for me they try and even manage to land on the Mars with complex machinery.

They're not going to announce anything interesting in the mainstream news. It's all debased garbage.

Google for mars conspiracies if you want to see real science. Ignore nattering academics, and trust your own judgement.

For real science listen to local radio hosts who know a lot more than they should.

Well, they made that breathless, exited announcement and then say "Oh, actually the whole mission is historical..."

I call BS.

They either had a preliminary finding that was promising, then it petered out.

Or they found something that indicated that there is absolutely no chance of life now or ever, something that would turn people off about future exploration. People simply do not want to spend billions on finding traces of magnesium oxide or whatever. Only scientists care about that sort of thing.

The least likely scenario involves finding out something that would scare us and cause people to panic, or upset social systems, and the govt wants to keep it secret like all that UFO stuff that people say they suppress for that reason.

Or somebody really did think that the discovery of some odd rock was really exciting.

According to the NASA app for iPad, "Something significant" in the tests performed by Curiosity....Nothing beyond that, but since they are looking for the basic building blocks of life, perhaps that's the big statement.

On a totally "Out There" theory...."Curiosity has discovered that intelligent life lived on Mars, built cities developed space travel ( Low orbit as us) and then fried themselves in an all out Nuclear war..."

I wouldn't hold my breath on that one though... <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":)"/>
