Saw an interesting article on yahoo I thought I'd share. I don't think it's been posted on here yet.

I think it's perhaps a bit too pessimistic. I really can't see Office losing a significant market share in the next few years, but all of their new products since the Zune seem to fall short of expectations. What do you guys think? Is the writing on the wall for Microsoft? Will they still be a major player in 10-15 years? I hope so. Ultimately it's good for consumers to have options.

I predicted that someone would leave a month ago before it happened, and on that day, I predicted that Ballmer wasn't going to last for another year. It's probably going to happen.

The Surface is horrible, and I don't think people are going to be happy with it six months down the line. My dad and I have used Windows since the 3.1 days, and this is just worthless tech. Everything from the keyboard to screen is low quality, and it's like, I don't know, using the back of a Smart Cover to type on? I know my way around Windows 8 because I have it here on my Mac, but it's relearning how to type all over again. I get free machines all the time, but I'm being honest here and saying that I would probably throw out the Surface if one ever ended up in my hands.

Office isn't dead, but it hasn't changed in the last 10+ years I've been using it. The interface has, but not the tools. I still have a copy of 2003 that I use.

Xbox? It's poorly done. You load up your system, and your dashboard is full of ads for apps you can't use without a subscription, and music you can't listen to without additional money. You spent $200+ on a console that is basically a HUGE ad. That's not how it's supposed to work.

I am curious....aside from the UI changes that they have most certainly done, what do you expect for a word processor or office suit in general in terms of change?

MS will benefit from it's current challenges, it has in the past.

Just like the recent shake up at Apple, it's good to have change.
