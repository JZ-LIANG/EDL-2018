I had no idea about this with the coverage Bush is getting. Maybe I'm watching the wrong news. RIP Stormin' Norman.

A friend of my Dad's whose husband served with Norman, said he was little more than a bully to his troops. Don't know anything else about him other than that he seems to be the last of his breed.

MOD NOTE: Please keep PRSI issues out of it lest the thread end up over there. If you have something political to say about it open your own thread in PRSI please.

Hmm. Hadn't known that. Disappointing but not terribly surprising.

I do, however, remember a number of the rather complimentary profiles - many of which were little more than puff pieces - which were penned at the time. Indeed, I also seem to recall that his name was floated - ever so briefly - as a possible Republican candidate for the Presidency, though he himself was quick to quash that.
