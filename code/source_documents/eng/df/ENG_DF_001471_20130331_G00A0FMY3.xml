Why was Nokia reluctant to adopt Android?

Think about it, why didn't Nokia switch to Android? They probably wouldn't in their current position if they chose to adopt Android. Partnering with Microsoft isn't that fruitful from the looks of it.

Just imagine the Nokia Lumia 920 but with Android, that would be really sexy.

Microsoft gave them quite a bit of money, so there you have it. I agree with you though. Windows Phone is awful.

Mr Elop.

A modern day Microsoft Trojan horse. I'm sure over time things will sort themselves out but Nokia have fallen way behind from their once dominant position.

I'd buy Nokia Android hardware in a heartbeat and do think their Lumia line of smartphones are great, Windows Phone included

Once the WP ecosystem picks up, Nokia will be the premier Windows Phone OEM. HTC, Samsung, ZTE and Huawei can't compete with Nokia engineering.

Nokia didn't need Android, much less Windows.

They needed SOMETHING. They were losing money either way. But agreed with the second poster, MS paid them to use Windows Phone instead of Android. Symbian was a dying OS with no hope left. <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":cool:"/>

They had been developing their new next generation OSes for years. The high end one was ready and with products until The Destroyer ruined everything.

The pittance MS money was no reason. Now Nokia pays more in licenses and they have made a lot of patent usage gifts.

They were not losing money when they decided to go for Windows. Sales were up, profits were up, ASP was up.

So much FUD and hatred, really guys?

It's because of 2 factors:

1) If Nokia went with Android, they would just "just another android manufacturer", along the lines of HTC. Not Samsung, HTC. That's not a good place to be right now ever.

2) Microsoft needed a partner, and was willing to pay $$$.

Personally I think it worked out pretty well for them, as they're the number 1 Windows Phone manufacturer. Interestingly enough, the only other notable WP manufacturer is another company that went Android and had it not work out - HTC.

I suppose they could have continued development on their Meego OS, but it was doomed, delayed, and buggy as hell.

Yes, "going really well". From #1 smartphone with Symbian at 30% marketshare before the meltdown to low single digits with Windows.

Meego was ready and the single device that was allowed to be sold IN MINOR MARKETS was getting rave reviews and selling more than WP even if stillborn.

The little MS money given was no real reason.

And nowadays MS doesn't give any money to Nokia at all, it's completely the other way around. Nokia is "just another Windows Phone manufacturer" along with HTC, Samsung and Huawei, they cannot customize their hardware (except the casing) or OS at all and now MS is even giving Nokia's maps and other software for free to every other manufacturer.
