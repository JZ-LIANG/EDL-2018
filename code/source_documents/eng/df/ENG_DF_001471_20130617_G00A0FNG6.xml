Syria riddle solved
</headline>

The Syrian war was preplanned and organised 2 years before the 'uprising' began according to former french foreign minister Roland Dumas:

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=5vz5EKlI3fQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=5vz5EKlI3fQ</a>

In the video, he says the british government (US lackey) officials approached him to participate in the overthrow of the assad government because of his firm stance against israel. In fact, at the end he says "those who do not cooperate with israel, will have to be crushed".

Surely he was told never to say a word, but obviously given his age may well have slipped out of his mouth.

There you have it, laid bare for all to see.

Next up, Iran!

Isn't it obvious? It's a conspiracy!

Sorry, I haven't formulated a theory yet, but give me some time.
The key elements will be the NSA (duh!), the Triliteral Commissariat (note: NOT the trilateral commission), the alleged flatness of iOS 7, and a donkey.

Oh, and nanothermite. On the donkey.

FYI, all donkeys are allergic to nanothermite charges. Your plan wouldn't work.

All donkeys you know of. Hence the other key element: the Triliteral Commissariat. Trust me, there are eminent donkey physiologists on it, as well as logistics experts, and highly trained chefs.

If you're familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigDog">BigDog</a> and its relatives, I'll just say they're nothing compared to donkeys.

Also, "Donkey Kong": not a translation mistake.

Are you sure, or is that just what they want you to think? If everyone thinks donkeys are allergic to nonothermite charges then no one will suspect a thing...

No sir, this is no conspiracy but rather FACT.

I think you have hearsay confused with fact.

It's certainly newsworthy, but it's just one person's word, and shouldn't be taken as any more than that without any kind of proof.

It's become that obvious I don't even think it's worth debating. We should have faith in what this foreign minister said as he knows the ins and outs of IR, as he is a credible source.

I don't know about that but given the US attempts to overthrow democratically elected governments it is hardly nuts to think they might be involved with doing the same to dictatorships.

Well let's think about this logically:

- 2011 protests erupt with Assad forces firing at civilians

- rebels quickly armed to the teeth with automatic rifles, rocket propelled grenades and machine gun equipped vehicles, despite the west claiming only benign equipment was sent.

- first signs of jihadists and al qaeda affiliates reported

- syrian national council is established calling for more arming of the FSA (which is a loose term that was applied to the now classified terrorist al nusra front at first)

- obama/cameron/hollande call for the immediate resignation of Assad, stalling and neglecting any politcal solution and conference UNTIL Assad actually resigns, which is counter productive and therefore curious behind what their motivations really are.

- videos emerge of rebels with foreign accents, chenchen and saudi namely, chopping people's heads off, commiting suicide bombings and cutting out their hearts and eating them while crying out 'allah akbar'

- in spite of fears we're backing lunatics, US and france claim sarin gas was used by the government with no visible proof even though signs suggest it is in fact rebels that have exercised the use of chemical weapons. They broker with the UK for lifting the arms embargo imposed by the EU, at a time where Assad forces are said to be making huge advances against foreign mercenaries.

Overall.... More than questionable this whole fiasco. All i know is 90,000 + people are dead, and the west and has a lot of explaining to do
