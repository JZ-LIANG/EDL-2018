Foxconn has announced a new smart wristband that can measure vital signs like respiration and heartbeat, and also check phone calls and Facebook posts, <a href="http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20130627000079&amp;cid=1206">according to a report</a> from the Want China Times.

Terry Gou, the head of Hon Hai Precision Industry -- the name of Foxconn's parent company -- said the company's research groups are looking to add fingerprint identification to the product as well. The device can make suggestions to the wearer on ways to improve their health if vital signs are out of the optimal range.

Hon Hai chairman Terry Gou said his company's wireless communications and medical research groups also plan to add new features such as fingerprint identification to the gadget in the future, to help record personal health data.

"With such a device, you can keep your phone in your pocket and simply check all kinds of messages on your watch," Gou told shareholders.

I wonder how many defective iPhones sneaked past their quality control while they were busy with an effin' useless wrist band.

Foxconn now believes it must be a consumer brand, and develop its own hardware and software. This is quickly going to become another Samsung situation for Apple.

I love how Foxconn thinks it can just hire 3,000 software developers and overnight becoming a player in software. Same goes with Samsung. Apple has a true competitive advantage in software.

As if "we'll spend whatever it takes" is how you get there

All the Foxconn jokes while ignoring that we're all dependent on them. It's not just Apple using them. Most consumer electronics coming out of China use them. HTC, Samsung, Nokia, Microsoft, Dell, Sony, and most everyone else us Foxconn. Thats why it was funny when Apple was the only one getting crap for using them as everyone else does too.

But it has no screen - how can it be a watch?

How is checking Facebook on this any easier than doing so on the app on your phone considering this has no screen and you have to go through an app to see that anyway? Or are they saying it will post to facebook for you? What is it posting? Your pulse?

Maybe it's not a watch. It's a "listen".
