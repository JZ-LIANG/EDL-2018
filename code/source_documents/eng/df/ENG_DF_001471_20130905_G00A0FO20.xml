Syria Poll. Are you for or against US involvement?

I am curious about the breakdown between liberal and conservative as I think this is one of those topics that might not be separated by party lines.

Not American.

But I firmly believe that the US would do it's self, and the world a great service, by staying out of Syria.

The use of chemical weapons against children cannot go unpunished. I fully support military action. I am a liberal leaning Independent.

We don't have a clear plan with a clear end-goal.

I can't support this action while we don't have that.

We're just going to bomb them for a bit. We're actually doing nothing about the supposed use of Chemical Weapons by Assad.

What evidence do you have that the attack was carried out by the Assad government? Would such military action be targeted at the right people? What if it kills a lot of innocent people? Who is going to rebuild the infrastructure destroyed? Should Assad be personally targeted, like Gadaffi and Hussein? Who is going to hold/pull the country together? Answers on no more than one sheet of A4, please.

No evidence was provided directly to me.

Yes.

What if it doesn't and kills exactly to whom the strike it was intended?

No.

It's citizens with international help.

I've written my Congressmen and hope he and our other elected officials decide to strike. I hope your Parliament reconvenes when they feel they have sufficient evidence and also votes to authorize a strike.

If your government is proposing to kill people and attack a foreign government in your name, don't you think they should be providing credible evidence of a "qualifying" crime?

<quote>
Yes.

Without evidence, you have no idea, quite apart from the inevitable collateral damage.

That would indeed be a first.

<quote>
No.

Why not?

What, like they do in Afghanistan, Libya and Iraq?

The only strike I would support is one against the "rebels" not the government. The west is proposing to get in on the wrong side of this fight.

Fundamentally I don't trust the security services one bit. If they want their evidence to be taken seriously they need to massively improve their credibility.

Left leaning independent against a strike. The poll options suck so I chose 'other'.

I've seen reports that phone calls to Congress are running 1200-1 against a strike.

Yes, the old children argument. I wouldn't break up a fight between two adults, but I would with an adult against a child. I understand my opinion is not popular. Not my concern.

Most fights I've seen between adults have been broken up.
