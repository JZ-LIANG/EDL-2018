Former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, considered one of the leading candidates to replace Steve Ballmer as CEO of Microsoft, is reportedly open to the possibility of broadening distribution of the company's Office suite to platforms such as iOS and Android should he be named to the position, according to a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-08/microsoft-ceo-candidate-elop-said-to-mull-windows-shift.html">report from Bloomberg</a>.

Elop would probably move away from Microsoft's strategy of using these programs to drive demand for its flagship Windows operating system on personal computers and mobile devices, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the 49-year-old executive hasn't finalized or publicly discussed his analysis of the business

The possibility of bringing Office to iOS has been rumored for a number of years, particularly since the 2010 introduction of the iPad. While Microsoft has an <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/06/14/microsoft-brings-office-mobile-for-office-365-subscribers-to-iphone/">Office Mobile app</a> for iPhone to allow subscribers to the company's Office 365 service to perform basic editing on Office documents, a full-fledged Office suite for iPad and iPhone has yet to appear. According to the most recent reports, Office for iPad is awaiting completion of a <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/10/08/microsoft-office-for-ipad-awaiting-completion-of-touch-first-interface-for-windows-version/">"Touch First" interface</a> that will come first to the Windows version of the suite in the early part of next year.

Elop spent nearly three years heading up Microsoft's Business Division, which is responsible for Office, before it was announced in September 2010 that he would be leaving the company to lead Nokia. Elop stepped down as Nokia CEO alongside the <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/09/02/microsoft-purchases-nokias-device-and-services-division-to-unite-windows-phone-hardware-and-software/">September announcement</a> that Microsoft would be acquiring Nokia's Devices and Services Division. He is scheduled to take charge of a new Microsoft division focused on devices such as Surface and Xbox, but is said to be under strong consideration to be named CEO.

Elop would reportedly also be open other major changes if he were to take charge of Microsoft, including selling off the Xbox division or shutting down the Bing search engine services. Outspoken Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw bluntly responded to Bloomberg 's request for comment, stating that "We appreciate Bloomberg's foray into fiction and look forward to future episodes."

Stephen Elop as CEO would make Microsoft a formidable opponent.

Elop Destroyed Nokia's value in a little over 6 months after taking over, I would seriously short M$ stock if he's tapped

Just not sure I'd use this much. I like the way Pages is being whittled down a bit since I really only need basic document editing and basic layout.

Word on iOS seems overkill for my needs. Maybe if I used it with a bluetooth keyboard... even so, I think that for the times I need the functionality of Office apps I would prefer a computer not a tablet as it would be for more complicated tasks that would benefit from more screen space and mouse/keyboard precision.

Someone other than a Steve/ Stephen maybe?

I think these Computer Giants should stop making guys with Steve as their first name the CEO. Maybe someone named Mark or Tom, or even someone with an awesome Irish name or something. Anything but Steve/Stephen.

Because then it really is going to get to the point where Microsoft and Apple fan people will wear shirts with " My Steve is better than your Steve," and then it's just going to get even uglier.

Of all of the things that I hope change direction when Microsoft gets a new CEO, Office for iOS is the very least of my concerns.

Boost in what? By the time they got Office on the iPad, we will have moved on to iWatches and dictate our work directly to the cloud and take holidays on Mars.

Nobody needs Microsoft Office. Pages, Numbers, Keynote are the killer apps that are driving productivity for millions of enterprise users on desktop and mobile platforms.

You forgot a smilie there. I would fix your post myself, but that's against the rules, so I'm relegated to merely letting you know. <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":)"/>
