iTunes Store Now Accepting Donations for Philippine Typhoon Relief
</headline>
<post author="MacRumors" datetime="2013-11-12T10:13:00" id="p1">
Apple has launched a <a href="https://buy.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZFinance.woa/wa/buyCharityGiftWizard">new page</a> on its iTunes Store allowing users to easily donate money to the American Red Cross toward Super Typhoon Haiyan relief efforts in the Philippines. The donation page, which is accessible through the main <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple.com page</a> and the desktop iTunes Store, permits donations at the $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, and $200 levels.

Apple will transfer 100% of each donation directly to the American Red Cross, allowing users to have their donations seamlessly billed to their existing iTunes Store accounts. With Apple currently holding over <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/06/04/apples-500-million-itunes-store-accounts-offer-significant-potential-for-growth-in-services/">500 million</a> iTunes Store accounts with credit cards attached, the company has a very significant customer base that can take advantage of the donation program.

Apple has conducted several similar campaigns in the past, most recently in <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/11/01/itunes-store-now-accepting-donations-for-superstorm-sandy-relief/">October 2012</a> following Superstorm Sandy, in <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/03/14/apple-accepting-red-cross-donations-on-itunes-for-japanese-relief-efforts/">March 2011</a> following the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, and in <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/01/15/itunes-store-facilitating-red-cross-donations-for-haitian-earthquake-relief/">January 2010</a> following the Haitian earthquakes.

Does anyone know how a charity gets on that page? The red cross is notorious for not spending its money on the specific disaster in question, husbanding the money for something else. Also, the donation is to the American Red Cross, even though the Philippines has its own Red Cross organization. Why?

Thanks for mentioning all this so I don't have to...I really wish people would take more care when selecting charities. There are many better charities out there than the red cross, whose CEO makes over a million bux each year.

So we shouldn't donate so they won't have ANY money to spend on ANY aid? Sounds like a smart idea.

I mean, if the way they do business means that they have billions of dollars ready for potential disasters, I'm all for that. As for them keeping 9% of the money, they need to get paid.

Red Cross no

The Red Cross keeps most of the money it receives to pay it's own expenses, including exorbitant salaries for upper management. If you want to make a donation to help people in the Philipines the Red Cross is NOT the way to go. Try <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org">http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org</a> instead.

You can use Charity Navigator to look the charity you're think about donating to.

For example, <a href="http://www.savethechildren.org/">Save The Children</a> gets <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4438">64/70</a>. Doctors Without Borders gets <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3628">57</a>. Red Cross gets <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3277">56</a>

There are many others to research, but any amount will help those in need in some way. Even if The Red Cross takes a bigger chunk for administrative purposes, they still spend a huge absolute amount on real aid.

This is incredible generosity from Apple. And only Apple can do this. This is one of the reasons I'm proud to be an Apple consumer.

Apple did the same thing after the horrific earthquake and tsunami struck Japan two and a half years ago. It's a fantastic gesture. I will be making my donation later today.

Great to see Apple once again step up to the plate, and offer use of their massive payment system at no cost, for a very worthwhile cause.

Many people use iTunes cards, rather than credit cards, for their purchases, so Apple could potentially raise even more money, if they allowed iTunes store credit as donations. Either way, kudos to them!

Yup. I'd rather give to an organization that will dispense most of the money.
