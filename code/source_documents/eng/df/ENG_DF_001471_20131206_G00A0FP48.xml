Apple has removed all product placements on its homepage tonight and has instead <a href="http://www.apple.com">replaced</a> them with an image of Nelson Mandela, honoring the late South African president's life a day after he <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/05/world/africa/nelson-mandela/">passed</a> at the age of 95.

Apple executives had previously commented on Mandela's death on Twitter, with SVP Phil Schiller <a href="https://twitter.com/pschiller/statuses/408934382658134016">tweeting</a> a quote from Mandela. CEO Tim Cook also <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/statuses/408939782924824576"> tweeted</a> a quote, but <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/statuses/408772726875111424">offered thoughts</a> on the passing of Mandela as well:

This is one of the few times Apple has honored someone's life on its homepage, with the others being people such as <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2005/10/26/apple-remembers-rosa-parks/">Rosa Parks</a>, board member <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/03/18/apple-director-jerome-york-passes-away-after-stroke/">Jerry York</a> and <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/05/steve-jobs-has-passed-away/">Steve Jobs</a>.

Great guy, big proponent of freedom and liberty. Of course if you didn't agree with him he could always send <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie_Madikizela-Mandela#Criminal_Convictions_and_Findings_of_Criminal_Behaviour">his wife</a> to murder you by tying a burning tire around your neck. And of course once he got power and she became a liability he dumped her. Other than that though, Mandela was a wonderful person.

Took the words right out of my mouth.

This is just another reason why I love Apple. They actually give a damn.

The World thanks him!

Mr. Mandela left behind a legend.

He, similar to Pope John Paul II, promoted peace and were able to bring South Africa out of a violent system, just like the Pope brought Poland out of communism.... peacefully.

I have nothing but great respect for Mr. President.

Rest In Peace!!!

This perfectly shows that Apple as a company is still, as much as ever, honoring the crazy ones.

I love this.

What other companies do this in honor of many historic figures? Not Samdung or LG!

I checked Apple's page earlier today for this. Google did a small tribute, as did Amazon.

And I am surprised that Google's tribute did not link to Google search results so they could capitalize on his passing.

Oh c'mon, Mandela would never do that since he cleaned up his act. If you did disagree with his policies he would do nothing more than shake your hand and secretly order a 7-year tax audit on your non-profit organization, like he did with Dr. Peter Hammond.

Incorrect. Mandela said that there is "no alternative to armed and violent resistance" and helped organize the ANC into a cell structure to facilitate persistent violence. Over the years, the ANC was involved in the deaths of thousands. This went on for thirty years, during which time Mandela somehow convinced a bunch of people he was a man of peace.

Now a person could well come to the conclusion that violence was justified against apartheid (or communism for that matter). However, the point remains that Mandela was a man of violence, nothing like JP2.

I see all of the acts of terrorism that Mandella engaged in that landed him in jail have been forgotten or just brushed aside.
