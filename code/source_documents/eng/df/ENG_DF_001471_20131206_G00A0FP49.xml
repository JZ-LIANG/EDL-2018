Why?

When was the last time US flags flew at half-staff for a foreign leader?

Flags at half staff to honor a man of global importance, strength, and impact.

Do you have a problem with honoring Mandela, and recognizing the world's loss by flying flags at half staff out of respect, remembrance, and mourning?

Selective respect, aka political correctness. It's called a bandwagon. No one here will utter the word 'terrorist', only 'freedoms fighter'. Which apparently allows the taking of lives, while the former doing it is abhorrent. Something like that.

Your post is off-topic. We do not talk about terrorists in this thread.

The better question would be:

Why not?

<quote orig_author="Barack Obama">
...
As a mark of respect for the memory of Nelson Mandela, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, December 9, 2013. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.

Ignoring the evident ignorance of Mandela's abjuration of violent protest during his career as expressed in this post...slinging the label "political correctness" is a cheap and easy denigration of a statement or position.

All it means is...one doesn't agree, but has no better argument than throwing up an overused, clich√© epithet.

You had two questions...

Why are flags flown at half staff for Mandela...and who was the last foreign leader for whom the flag was flown at half staff.

It seems a bit disingenuous to suggest, as you did in the post above, that neither of your question were answered. The first question did receive responses...the second question answered later in the thread.

BTW: My understanding is the the "order" did not apply to private citizens, but rather to public buildings.
