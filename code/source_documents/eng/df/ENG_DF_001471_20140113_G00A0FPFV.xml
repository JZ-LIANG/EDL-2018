U.S. District Judge Denise Cote today denied Apple's attempts to thwart its antitrust monitorship, reports <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/13/us-apple-antitrust-idUSBREA0C1HY20140113">Reuters</a>. Apple had asked the court for both a stay on the original order requiring an external compliance monitor (due to a pending appeal) and the removal of Michael Bromwich, the attorney appointed to serve as the company's monitor. Both requests were denied.

Apple Inc lost a bid on Monday to block an antitrust monitor appointed after a judge's finding that the company conspired to fix e-book prices. At a hearing, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan denied Apple's request to stay an order requiring an external compliance monitor pending the company's appeal.

Apple also sought to have the judge disqualify the lawyer chosen to serve as monitor, Michael Bromwich.

Apple and appointed antitrust compliance monitor Bromwich have <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/11/29/apple-files-formal-complaint-over-monitor-fees-in-e-book-antitrust-case/">ongoing disagreements</a> since November, when Apple filed a formal complaint over Bromwich's fees in the case, which amounted to $138,432 over a two week period. The company also complained that Bromwich was overstepping his bounds by demanding lawyer-less meetings with key Apple executives and board members.

Bromwich, for his part, claimed that he experienced "a surprising and disappointing lack of cooperation from Apple and its executives", <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/12/31/external-compliance-monitor-apple-is-blocking-interviews-disrupting-e-book-antitrust-investigation/">filing a complaint</a> against the company in late December. Apple responded by <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/01/07/apple-requests-removal-compliance-monitor-e-book-case/">requesting his removal</a> last week, stating that Bromwich had a personal bias against the company.

Earlier today, the Department of Justice <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/01/13/feds-accuse-apple-of-character-assassination-in-fight-over-antitrust-monitor/">condemned</a> Apple's actions, stating Apple had "chosen a campaign of character assassination over a culture of compliance" and suggested that Bromwich was open to negotiating with Apple on the original fee dispute.

Judge Cote plans to issue a decision explaining her reasoning on the denial in the near future, at which point Apple will have 48 hours to request an emergency stay from the federal appeals court in New York.

Apple was originally <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/07/10/apple-found-guilty-of-conspiring-to-fix-prices-in-e-book-trial">found guilty</a> of conspiring with publishers to raise the retail price of e-books in July. As part of its punishment, the company was forced to hire an external compliance monitor to ensure that it complies with antitrust requirements in the future.

The judge shouldn't be allowed to pick her friends. It should be a reputable party who has no relation to the judge at all.

I can understand denying the request to get rid of the monitor entirely, given that they were found guilty, but the simple fact that this monitor had to bring in an outside expert who gets paid as much as he does to do the job he was expressly hired to do should have disqualified him from being appointed in the first place, and I can't honestly see how it's anything but a favor by the judge.

I mean, really, if you were sent to a repair guy to get your car fixed, and the repair guy handed it off to an "expert in repairing cars" because he was actually an appliance repairman, then billed for both his and the expert's time, you'd say that the repair guy was incompetent and should never have been given the work in the first place.

How is this any different? Because lawyers are special flowers who get to take work they don't know how to do and bill fabulous amounts of money for hiring outside help to do the work?

Lets see what she writes in her explanation. And then lets see how long it takes for Apple to file for an emergency stay. My guess is that it is all ready to go and just waiting for her to file her explanation. Apple will fight hard to keep anyone who doesn't belong out of their secrets.

I don't even begin to understand why the court would be unwilling to assign a new monitor. Why does it matter who the monitor is, if there isn't something shady going on.

It is very apparent that there most likely is a conflict of personality between the current monitor and Apple and that both parties feel like it is impeding their ability to get work accomplished. Seems simple, change out the monitor. If the monitor is doing what they are assigned to do why does it matter who the monitor is.

This seems to be a very odd response especially in light of the fact that the monitor (Bromwich) is an old friend of the judge on the case (Cote).
