That's pretty cool that a CEO of a private company has the power to meet with world leaders.

Even cooler that he picks a nation that has a newly formed re-alliance with Iran. The first NATO nation to also allow Al Qaida to roam freely.

Seems that Cook is like a dog that will wiggle on any vertical economic opportunity.

I look forward to a meeting between him and Vladimir Putin. But I would interpret it differently from you. It would be an opportunity to spread Apple's values of promoting creativity.

Apple should retain from politics.

Meeting the Turkish president makes sense considering a $4.5 billion deal.

What creativity do you speak of? Apple is not about creativity but about telling us it is cool to own an Apple device. Apple is about profit and that makes it no different than any other large company.

I guess we should consider whoring ourselves to anyone...including those that would house terrorists openly that wish our demise.

The principle of what you are saying is sound (although nowadays the definition of what constitutes a "terrorist" is often very gray), but we need to start making these kinds of demands to our politicians before we worry about manufacturers of consumer goods.

I don't really know how to react to these comments. Apple is an American company and we buy s***load of iStuff. There is a store opening and APPLE wants a bigger share since market here today belongs to 3rd party sellers and maniac carries who looo000ove yanking out incredible amount of money and imprison us to their 2-3 years long, so called, contracts.

So, why don't you take your meager knowledge of politics or whatever and go to some other thread or stop getting off-topic, please.
