According to an e-mail sent to customers by Apple this morning, much awaited Apple Store is opening to Istanbul/Turkey next Saturday April 5th. They announced that they were going to open the store more than 1.5 years ago but stated the construction of the store and education of employees took a long time. They launched the iTunes Music store almost half a year ago also in Turkey with considerably good pricing. Here are some photos from the much awaited store, in the Zorlu Center Mall next to all luxurious brands' stores.

It says: "We are headed towards Istanbul. Apple Store Zorlu Center. We are there on April 5th."

Also, another photo from the construction site from March 24th;

The store's architecture is expected to be similar to famous flagship New York 5th Avenue store with the cubic glass entrance. It is also expected to be one of the largest Apple Stores in the world with one of the best architecture and materials used. Apple is stated to plan this as a flagship store.

The rumours also suggest that Apple will have 5 stores in total by the end of 2015, in 3 cities; Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir. Second Istanbul store's location is also leaked as Akasya Mall in the Asian side of the city. (Istanbul is a unique city that is literally on both Europe and Asia in case you didn't know)

I am pretty excited about this. Now Turkey being one of the countries with official Apple Stores, I'm curios to see if this means concurrent launches of devices with the rest of the world.

Cool, finally a reason to visit Istanbul! (Kidding)

I visited Turkey some years back - in 2005 - took a tour around Cappadocia. Beautiful country and very hospitable people. I must go back, Istanbul and quite a few other destinations. <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":cool:"/> If I have a problem with my iPhone I'll have a place to pop in to!!

I forgot to add something. Multi-colored dots that form the top of Apple logo on the sign around the store (the drapes?) is a reference to the bridge connecting the European and Asian sides of the city. The light pattern of the bridge is on that sign that says opening on April 5th in the first two photos of the original post. Here's that bridge;
