A federal judge has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/28/us-apple-ebooks-idUSBREA2R1Y120140328">granted class action status</a> to a group of plaintiffs suing Apple over its antitrust collusion with publishers to increase the price of e-books, reports Reuters. The judge, Denise Cote, is the same judge who <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/07/10/apple-found-guilty-of-conspiring-to-fix-prices-in-e-book-trial/">oversaw the antitrust case</a> against Apple by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Judge Cote has been <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/11/29/apple-files-formal-complaint-over-monitor-fees-in-e-book-antitrust-case/">accused by Apple</a> of overstepping her judicial authority by giving a court-appointed monitor wide authority at Apple to interview and make changes at the company. Apple requested that the lawyer chosen to serve as the monitor be disqualified, saying he had over-stepped his bounds by asking for lawyer-less meetings with key Apple executives and board members. That request was <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/01/13/apple-compliance-monitor-removal-denied/">denied at appeal</a>.

U.S. District Judge Denise Cote said the plaintiffs had "more than met their burden" to allow them to sue as a group. She rejected Apple's contentions that the claims were too different from each other, or that some plaintiffs were not harmed because some e-book prices fell.

Some have estimated that Apple could <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/07/25/apple-could-owe-500-million-after-being-found-guilty-in-e-book-antitrust-case/">owe as much as $500 million</a> after being found guilty in the Federal antitrust case, with more judgements possible in this class-action suit if the plaintiffs are successful.

This class action suit applies only to consumer plaintiffs in the states where the governments have not already sued Apple. Previously, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-01/apple-should-pay-840-million-over-e-books-states-say.html">33 states and territories sued Apple</a> on behalf of their consumers, seeking more than $800 million in damages.

Oh boy. Get ready for the upset people frothing at the mouths because Apple is getting sued.

Now, if the news was reversed, and the judge declined class action status, this would have been on the front page and not the sidebar. <img src="http://forums.macrumors.com/mrimages/appleblack.png" alt=":apple:"/>

Serious question, why isn't there a different judge deciding this instead of Cote?

Logically, she should be the last option on the list of federal judges to be selected on this case considering that she just issued a judgment against Apple in the same case. To make it fair and just, a different judge should determine this, not Cote.

I'm not familiar with how the judges are picked but does anybody here know?

Eliminate class action lawsuits completely. Only the scummy lawyers make money. I get invites to be part of class action lawsuits all the time. Just got notice in the mail the other day that after being sued for 7 years, a company which I used to own shares in settled for $60 million, 33% of which will go to the lawyers. Class action lawsuits just make the price of all products go up. Plaintiffs get a few dollars, maybe a $100 if they are lucky, while scummy lawyers get millions and some even get in the hundreds of millions in jackpot class action lawsuits like tobacco. Lawyers are lower than the lowest form of parasite.

Enjoy your free books everyone. <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

Really, you agreed to the price when you bought the books to begin with, absolutely no point why consumers should be getting a refund. It should be a slap on the wrist for Apple, Amazon, and the others, nothing more.

I was surprised that I even got one. Bought four books with it.

Ah, yes, the bizzaro world of Judge Denise Cote, where the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Act">Sherman Act</a> is used to grant an ebook monopoly to Amazon.
