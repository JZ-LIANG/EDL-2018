Members of the press were given a tour of Apple's newest retail store in Istanbul, Turkey before its grand opening tomorrow, April 5th, reports <a href="http://appletoolbox.com/2014/04/apples-steve-cano-shows-istanbul-store-press-pictures/">Apple Toolbox</a>. Leading the tour was Apple's manager of retail stores, Steve Cano, who confirmed that CEO Tim Cook will not attend the opening as <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/03/05/apple-istanbul-store/">originally expected</a>. Turkish President Abdullah GÃ¼l also will postpone his visit until after the retail store is opened.

The 20,000 square foot store, which is located in the upscale Zorlu Center, <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/04/02/all-glass-turkish-apple-store/">features</a> a unique cubic design with a glass ceiling and glass sides. According to Cano, the store uses more glass than any previous Apple Store and contains special glass materials that take full advantage of the sun light in the open area of the mall.

Wow that store is gorgeous, by the way I find it funny when closed minded people leave comments.. Turkey is a beautiful place with beautiful people, so are many other places in the Middle East..

Travel broadens the mind, I've been to some of these places, the people are the most welcoming and kind around, despite what you hear from the mainstream media which by the way are owned by corporations..

Just wanted to say that because, whenever people talk about this region they always point out the bad and never the good, and I find it disgustingly insensitive and frankly rather immature, learn some empathy for others..

Their government obviously hasn't figured out that its better to secretly monitor what everyone is doing on the internet rather than trying block bits of it <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

Actually, unfortunately, it works like crap when Twitter, Facebook and Youtube are blocked.

I lived in China for 8 years. The number of websites that include "tweet" and "like" buttons, embed youtube videos, "use Facebook or Twitter to login", etc etc is very high. At in China, when a page starts to download an asset from one of those sites (a like button, some javascript for liking, etc) the whole loading process grinds to a halt until it times out after like 1 min. Massively painful. And obviously you can't use FB or Twitter credentials to login to websites.

Even when I wasn't going to FB, Twitter, Youtube, I basically had to get on a VPN just to have something even close to a reasonable browsing experience.

Regarding the inevitable comments about Turkey's politics:

Don't take it out on the country as a whole. It's a beautiful place, and I've met many very smart and friendly people there who are extremely upset and frustrated about the current situation. (At least 56% of the votes were not for the ruling party in last week's elections, possibly even more.)

Besides, so many people there are willing to stand up for their rights, although even peaceful protesters are being violently attacked by the police. Personally, I think that's worthy of respect, not ridicule.

Their current government, on the other hand... they deserve all the ridicule and disrespect you can muster. <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=";)"/>

Would love to see an Apple Store in Green Bay, WI. Right now I have to travel 2-3 hours to get to a Apple Store. We are the 3rd largest city in Wisconsin so no reason we shouldn't have one.
