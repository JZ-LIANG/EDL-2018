According to <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/230008153/Apple-e-books-settlement-order">a letter</a> filed in the Southern District Court of New York, Apple has reached an out-of-court settlement with both class action lawyers and state district attorneys over e-book price-fixing, reports <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-06-16/apple-settles-e-books-pricing-case-with-states-consumers">Bloomberg</a>.

Settlement details remain sealed and must be approved by the court. If approved, this agreement will end litigation ahead of <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-cannot-escape-u-states-213206984.html">a potentially costly damages trial</a> that was slated to begin July 14. Apple faced more than <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/03/28/class-action-ebook-lawsuit/">$800 million in damages</a> in this class-action antitrust lawsuit involving both consumers and states.

Steve Berman, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said by phone that all the U.S. attorneys general and consumers settled the case. Berman said he filed a memorandum of understanding with the court under seal, which prevents him from describing the agreement.

In an earlier decision, Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/07/10/apple-found-guilty-of-conspiring-to-fix-prices-in-e-book-trial/">was found guilty</a> of conspiring to fix e-book prices in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. As part of its preparations for launching the iBookstore alongside the iPad in 2010, Apple sought to weaken Amazon's hold on the industry and change the business model that governed the sale of e-books, an effort that resulted in higher prices for consumers. Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/02/26/apple-appeals-ebooks-case/">filed an appeal</a> in that case earlier this year.

Glad this is out of the way, it was a slam dunk, they clearly did conspire to keep prices high, the evidence is clear for everyone to see except those who dont want to.

Amazon kept (and keeps) book prices low, people talk about a "monopoly" but it patently isn't, there are numerous places to buy books from, online or in print. The only monopoly (or to be accurate oligopoly) was the conspiracies of a handful of major publishers and Apple to keep prices high.

Indeed. Customers and authors are better served by Amazon's values than Apple's. Hopefully this has put Apple in their place.

But book prices have not changed. Amazon still sells books as a loss lead at the author/publisher's expense, and iBooks are still MSRP sticker priced. This whole thing accomplished nothing but putting money in lawyer's pockets.

The only thing the "conspirators" did was enact an agency model which keeps vendors like Amazon from instituting aggressive "loss leaders". These below-cost prices which would eventually turn into predatory contract negotiations like we have now with Hatchette and Time Warner.

And it's not over for either Apple or Amazon.

Of course book prices have changed !!! Previously Amazon was not allowed to sell books below a certain price, or loss lead. Now they are. They even had a sign on those books to the effect of "we arent allowed to sell these books below this price by the publisher". Thats gone now and prices have dropped.

Whether or not iBooks are still MSRP sticker priced is irrelevant, as long as they are cheaper on Amazon.
