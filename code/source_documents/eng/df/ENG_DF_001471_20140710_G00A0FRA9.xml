Microsoft reboots again
</headline>

Last year we had Ballmer's 'One Microsoft' devices and services strategy (and along with it a 2700+ worded memo to employees). One year later we get another extremely long memo from Nadella and devices and services is renamed mobile and cloud. If I worked for Microsoft I'd be a little worried about needing these long memos to communicate what Microsoft is all about. And then getting two of them within a year of each other.

Seems to me things would be a lot clearer if Microsoft spun off its hardware business. Getting into the devices business is a distraction IMO. It's difficult to be both horizontal and vertical. I still think their Nokia purchase was more about saving Windows Phone platform than wanting to get in the phone hardware business. Spin off XBox, Surface and Windows Phone devices into a separate company and let Microsoft focus on what it does best - software and services.

Microsoft just can't stop "rebooting".

Partly to save the platform and partly to mimic apple. They see the wisdom of a tightly integrated OS and hardware.

That's the problem. Ballmer felt Microsoft needed to mimick Apple. I don't think Nadella does. Making a touch version of Office for iOS and Android first proves it.

It's interesting that this quarter Apple and Microsoft report earnings on the same day (July 22). I'm seeing some predictions of layoffs at Microsoft. I would not be surprised if they announce org changes and layoffs with their earnings release. I'm sure the stock will jump on that news as Microsoft is kind of bloated, but I'll bet if they announced a spinoff of their hardware business the stock would jump even more. I would not be surprise if within the next 5 years Microsoft sheds it's hardware business.

Microsoft's Entertainment Division (the people that make X-Box and the likes) are their most profitable in terms of hardware. That alone should be a company.

I think Microsoft as a company has so much to offer if they focus on what brought them to their heights. That focus should be on software on many devices.

Although, it would be pretty much interesting to see a Windows line of laptops (branded by Microsoft's a la Apple style with their Mac line). You never truly know your software's potential until you mate it with extremely integrated hardware. This is what Apple has so far been doing; very well mind you.

Bringing Office to iPad and Android is great decision. Microsoft would have lost marketshare to other productivity apps out there seeing as they would have been alienating a vast majority of devices that are widespread use.

'Dat Memo!

<quote>
D: Well, how did you know I wrote that memo?

MJF: How did I know you wrote that memo? Who else could write that memo, Davidson? That memo was famous. That memo was a masterpiece. Clear, concise, to the point. That was the best damn memo I ever read! In fact, that memo wasn't even a memo. That memo was literature.

D: Well, thank you.

MJF: You're welcome.

B: If you have finished your book report, could you explain what your point is?

MJF: The point is, we gotta be bold. That's my point.

I saw that and was surprised to a degree.
I guess Nadella is looking to sharpen its focus and cut out some of the bloat that creeps into an organization.

Nadella is new as CEO still. The fact that he still has changes to make in order shape the company how he desires it is hardly surprising.

I am starting to think they are trimming their Old Nokia staff and old Nokia workers.
