First he starts his layoff memo with the phrase "Hello There". Then it takes until the 11th paragraph to actually mention 12,500 people would be losing their jobs. And this is the way he announced it:

<quote>
We plan that this would result in an estimated reduction of 12,500 factory direct and professional employees over the next year. These decisions are difficult for the team, and we plan to support departing team members with severance benefits.
</quote>

"we plan to support departing team members with severance benefits" is all the sympathy or feeling he can muster? And when he says "these decisions are difficult for the team" it sounds so impersonal and uncaring, as if he feels bad for himself and his managers, not the people losing their jobs. Also, why spread this out over a year? The most painless way to implement job cuts is do them quickly. Why not tell people now but give them time to either find another job within the company or externally? I can't see how this is good for morale. Who would give 100% not knowing if they're one of the 18,000 or not?

Elop is the one that needs to go.

Could it be the memo was written in another language and something was lost in translation.

Or at the very least, taking the conventions of another language and culture. We Americans want to get to the point. Give me bullet items, where as other cultures tend to be more expansive.

I won't criticize for over communicating, though he does seem to be beating around the bush.

Elop was placed at Nokia by Microsoft with what was likely a known safety clause to return to Microsoft, once Nokia was absorbed. I doubt he gives two craps about the Nokia employees. I think they knew they were cannon fodder the second rumors came out that Microsoft would be buying Nokia.

And I have no love for Elop. This is one of those monkey's that Microsoft still has in their ranks from the Ballmer days and should be axed by Nadella. But the guy probably has a clause or contract preventing such action at this time.
