At this moment 14 years ago, millions of Americans went to bed quietly, with no thought that the next morning their world would change forever. That hundreds packed flight bags they would never live to open. Thousands slept with loved ones for the last time.
One never knows what a new day has in store. Let us live each day to the fullest, and never miss a chance to let those dearest to us know our love for them.

I see a big difference between the interventions in those places. To this day, evidence of prohibited weapons under international law in Iraq has not showed up. That was the whole point of going in. The whole point of going in this time is to defeat a threat that is known and has been observed. The threat exists and we see evidence of that on our news screens daily.

Broke international law. We didn't attack Syria on our own initiative. It was a NATO affair, of which the US was a part.

Though I think it's kind of funny seeing this, considering one of my more Republican friends linked a page the other day blaming Obama for not doing enough in Syria.

We have no business getting involved in a civil war,
Had no business getting involved with Libya either. Your link seems to be from your republican friend.

I thought that's what you wanted.

Do you want proof of NATO involvement? Just read up on any report concerning our involvement with Syria at the time. We spearheaded the effort, but everyone from Australia to Canada to Morocco played a part. Comparing it to Iraq is like comparing apples to oranges.

You don't have to agree with the actions taken, but you can't use one as an argument against the other.

I think you will find that the conflicts in Syria and Libya started in their own.

Considering ISIS was making a play in Syria at the time, we did have some stake in the conflict.
