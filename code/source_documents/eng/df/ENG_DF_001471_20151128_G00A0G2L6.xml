so not only was he a felon and not allowed a gun he was attacking his wife. but hey it is perfectly ok to shoot someone because they are stopping you from beating up someone. only in murica™ would this be ok. so no news on if he is in trouble with having a gun or attacking his wife. of course they guy was not armed or anything but does it really matter? we can shoot who we want as long as we have a good excuse.

The stand your ground defense has been used by many to escape criminal charges. A known felon from South Carolina was allowed to walk away from charges after using a gun to defend himself, despite being banned from owning one.

By some grace of legal mumbo jumbo, Isaac Baughman, 27, managed to <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2015/11/sc-felon-uses-stand-your-ground-law-to-walk-after-shooting-death-even-though-hes-banned-from-having-gun/">escape criminal charges</a> for fatally shooting his 19-year-old brother-in-law Stephen Brown in December of 2014.

Judge R. Ferrell Cothran dismissed the charges and bought Baughman’s self-defense argument. However, laws in the state forbid convicted felons from possessing firearms. Ignoring the law, Cothran ruled that the use of the firearm was justified as the illegal gun was used inside of Baughman’s home.

Baughman’s wife, Candace Brown, disagrees with the ruling and wants justice for her brother who was shot in the chin by her husband.

Brown was the victim of an abusive relationship and had called her brother to come and help her.

“The next thing I know he’s walking toward the door and then at that point I see my brother go toward the porch and then I hear the gun go off,” Brown said. “It was within seconds after he walked out of the door. Like five seconds.”

Next time call the cops?

The wife and brother in law are the ones in the wrong. She should have called the cops and the brother should have done so as well. Certainly he shouldn't have gone over there if he even remotely suspected there was going to be violence and given the circumstances it's fair to say there likely was going to be.

SYG does allow the owner of a home to defend himself and technically the gun may not be owned by him so perhaps that's the direction the judge used when deciding. Don't know, don't have the details. Wife shouldn't have had the gun in the house if she was housing a felon.

was the gun owned by him or the wife? should the wife have a gun in the home if he's a felon? should the wife have a gun in the home if she's too afraid herself to deal with the husband? should the wife have even been in the home still? why didn't the wife call the cops? why would the brother go over to a known hostile situation without a LEO?
Hey, sad story but lots of opportunities that look like needed to have been thought through and weren't.

this is a stand your ground failure. using SYG when it is actually murder. it said he owned the gun. few wines use guns against their husbands. SYG is often used for murder by felons and even while they commit felons. but guns are the only important thing in murica™ seems everything else is second.
