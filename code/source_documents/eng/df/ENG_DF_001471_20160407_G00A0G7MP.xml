Has Trump changed his stance since then? If so, on what issues and why? It's very fair for him to change his stance on issues. I've not kept up.

Sorry, you and I will never see eye to eye on this. I think he has been a great president. I think history will also bear this out.

I bet if Bush had already had the loosely worded authorizations to use force that Obama had left over from the Bush administration he wouldn't have bothered with going through congress for another one.

It's politics. Trump will lambast Obama, the way Trump is ragging on his fellow Republicans. Nobody is safe. Hey, look at The Bern calling out Hillary as unacceptably prepared to be president.

Trump is a lifelong long liberal. Not surprised at all.

True he says one or two things to appeal to a certain type of mouth breather in the south, but I know he would govern more like a center left politician.

Better than expected? Haha, what?

Why is [transgendered] Chelsea Manning still rotting away imprisoned for 35 years? Why the **** is Edward Snowden still trapped in Russia? Why has Obama maliciously and vindictively targeted, charged and/or prosecuted more government whistleblowers than all previous presidents in U.S. history COMBINED x2 ? Why is Obama also the first president in U.S. history to prosecute a BLACK whistleblower (Jeffrey Sterling)? Why is Obama still illegally spying on over 100,000,000 Americans daily (far worse spying crimes than what Bush did)? Why is Obama protecting 9/11 co-conspirators (treason)? Why has Obama then conspired WITH those very same [Saudi] 9/11 co-conspirators to attempt overthrow of the Syrian government that has not attacked America (treason)? Why is Obama blocking BLACK 9/11 families and survivors from justice, after they have publicly pleaded with Obama to help them but instead Obama has sided with al-Qaeda that helped to murder their loved ones? Why hasn’t Obama declassified the 28 pages like he promised leading 9/11 families to their faces he would? Why has Obama bombed more countries than Bush? Why has the Obama regime dropped more bombs than the Bush regime? Why has Obama murdered more civilians with drones, than Osama had murdered civilians with planes? Why did Obama sign into law the largest military spending bill in history, that included provision on secret indefinite detention of Americans with no charge or trial, that according to Sen. Carl Levin: Obama demanded be included or he wouldn’t sign it? Why is Obama the least transparent POTUS in history, breaking every Most Transparent Administration Ever™ promise and doing everything possible to undermine government transparency? Why is Obama the most hostile POTUS to the press in history, intimidating American journalists and their sources, and forcing journalists under threat of imprisonment to name their sources in federal court? Why has Obama protected Bush admin and CIA officials for torture war crimes? Why has Obama protected them for Iraq war crimes? OBAMA IS THE BIGGEST AND FAKEST JOKE IN U.S. POLITICS EVER.
