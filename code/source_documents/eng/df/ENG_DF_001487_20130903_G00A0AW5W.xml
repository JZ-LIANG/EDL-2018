Well, now we know the price, no surprise otherwise. Stunningly cheap, given the one-time market valuation of Nokia that topped $100B. Elop is a Redmond guy and alreay bet the farm on Windows Mobile, so he’s coming back home.
When Google paid $12.5B for Motorola Mobility, it gained a substantial portfolio of valuable patents and IP. Since Nokia’s IP cupboard was already bare (or it wouldn’t have had to jump to Windows OS), the same is doubtful in this deal. Plus, Google has a habit of making acquisitions better and growing into new spaces whereas Microsoft does just the opposite.
I suspect MSFT shareholders will be happy they only paid $7B once the buyers remorse kicks in.

The best part of the deal is Microsuck using their offshore cash to fund this.
Take that! T-man and blow it out the backside of yer frenemy, the G-men.

Nokia still has a very large portfolio, over 10k strong in patents(How many are phone and communication patents I don’t know).
This was the end game all along though since MS has been infusing cash into Nokia for awhile and Nokia is by far the biggest Win Phone maker now. I think people forget Nokia is still the third largest phone maker, albeit the majority are dumb phones and older symbians, the Windows phones were there biggest profit maker.
There is long term profit to be made off of them still

$7.5 bezillion, according to CNET. Know why? One reason: the cash sitting overseas that M’soft cannot bring stateside without paying 35% to Uncle Sam for foo stams, Section 8, NSA and other such critical expenses that your representatives have approved and continue to approve. Investing overseas. Apple is another company that’s been buying foreign firms with overseas cash. Why shouldn’t they?

Yep, interesting. Nokia makes some pretty solid handsets. Will be interesting to see if MS bleeps it up.

Leaves them with 3.00 a share, no debt. Microsoft just got the bargain of the century, IMHO. This increased Microsoft net per phone from 10.00 to 40.00. Unlimited use of patents for 10 years with rights to renew perpetuity.
Microsoft still want to continue relationships with other phone manufactures. About 32K employees will transfer to Microsoft leaving Nokia with 52K employees.
Interesting to see what the market values the company.
