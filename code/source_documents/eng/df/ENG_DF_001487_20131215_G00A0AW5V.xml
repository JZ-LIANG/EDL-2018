Beijing (AFP) - China's Jade Rabbit rover vehicle drove onto the moon's surface on Sunday after the first lunar soft landing in nearly four decades, a huge advance in the country's ambitious space programme.
The Yutu, or Jade Rabbit, was deployed at 4:35 am (2035 GMT Saturday), several hours after the Chang'e-3 probe landed on the moon, said the official news agency Xinhua.
Both the rover and lander are expected to take photos of each other later Sunday, it said.

Neat! Maybe the Chinese will actually do something with the moon.

Forty years ago, America was great. Shouting out old press clippings is cheerleading for failure. Now the US mantra is, ‘Embrace the Suck’.
In a few years, due to their superior economic system, the Chinese will have the first choice of American slaves over the Muslims. Free markets and non US Union labor have freed China from the socialist madness of the past.

There was an article here yesterday in which the state controlled “media” proclaimed Barry’s showing up for the Mandela Dean Martin Roast a “great suckcess.” The “media” loves the guy.

China will have their own space station and have boots on the moon in less than a decade. Their economy on purchasing power basis will be larger as well.
It’s going to be a huge shock to the U.S. psyche when this all happens in the course of a few years.

Coming from a nation that is rapidly heading back to the 30's, I'm sure China will take that as a great compliment.

China already exports more than America.
And is growing very very quickly.
Both political parties in America, seem to be 100% on selling out America.

I wish the U.S. would get back to the 60s (in this regard, at any rate).

Only way to make America great again is to divide it in two like Pakistan/India.
Liberty lovers on one side of the divide, socialists all on the other.
There is no other answer... I wish there was.

How would that do anything?
Both parties are selling out America.
What would change if the country were divided? Both sides of the divide, would be selling out to China individually.
I think. How is this wrong please?

I don’t propose a division by party but by ideology.
I once called myself Republican, no longer. I won’t belong to a party that would elect Boner the Bawler to a leadership post.

I wonder how Jimmah Carter feels about "Jade Rabbit"? <img src="http://willrabbe.com/storage/Jimmy%20Carter%20Rabbit%20Boat%20CloseUp.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1296160537647"/>

IMHO you are correct. What shall be the dividing line and name? We’re willing to move although sponges don’t survive in the cold.

1930’s? With our energy for industrialization coming from the latest in 15th century wind technology and pre-Colombian solar power, the 1930’s actually sounds pretty modern.

Just remember, Red China has made no treaties with any other nation about anything ‘high-altitude’ or ‘space’, as we and the Soviets (who are not around any more), did!

It is very sad but both US and Russia has fallen so much beyond their past capabilities in terms of technology and science.
