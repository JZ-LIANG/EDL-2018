McCains campaign is becoming frightening

At McCain rallies they are pumping up the crowd before McCain and Palin come out by trashing Obama and calling him Husein Obama. This is followed by Palin basically accusing him of being a terrorist based on his limited association with Ayers. At one rally during the "terrorist" part of her accusations, someone shouted out "Kill him" to which she supposedly replied, "I want to kill em too". Now I feel sure that if she said that, she referred to a victory in the election, but what did that redneck idiot who shouted out "Kill him" think as the crowd roared? This drumming up of unwarranted hatred for Obama is dangerous and a sick picture of the inside the Republican base. It could produce a tragic consequence. I certainly hope not.

Good article here.

Personally I think she is just adding more nails to her coffin and making herself look a bloody racist idiot.

Some of the comments below the brief article here give an idea what people with common sense think of her. There are a few in favor of her, and when you read them you realize they are from people without a lot of common sense, or brains.
Like this one...
YES. I relate to Sarah Palin. She is exactly the VP that we need. A strong partner to President McCain.

Smart, honest, patriotic, pro-life woman! She’s more than ready to lead.

Another bonus: she is not friends with a terrorist who bombed the Pentagon.

OBAMA’S “CHANGE”? Take a look at what Fidel did to Cuba and how he “changed” it. Is that how you want to live in the USA????

GO MCCAIN and PALIN! I’M VOTING FOR EXPERIENCE AND INTEGRITY!

or this one
Barak Hussein Obama is a Socialist/Marxist/Communist running for the New Party out of Chicago. Look it up!

I would rather have a Hockey Mom in the white house than someone who hates everything this country stands for — like the Constitution!!!

Wake up people. Do your own homework — don’t rely on CNN
