He said he would meet dangerous world leaders for top level talks without pre-conditions if elected president.

He met George Bush yesterday.

"W" is known to pal around with terrorists. He hosted Arafat in the White House. Kind of makes Obama's prior dalliances pale in comparison. <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>

He's not kept one of his election promises. That was to not have any lobbyists in the White House. Now he has gone back on that and said there will be some there. IMO the lobbyists were one of the problems that f**ked it up in the first place. Greasing politicians hands on behalf of the companies and individuals that employed them. I'm really disappointed in Obama now.

Where are the quotes/links for this? I've even just checked Fox &lt;ack&gt; News and can't find anybody reporting the story.

Which former lobbyist specifically is he vetting for what position? <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/confused.gif"/>

Thank you, I didn't catch much news last night.

"President-elect Barack Obama, who vowed during his campaign that lobbyists 'won't find a job in my White House,' said through a spokesman yesterday that he would allow lobbyists on his transition team as long as they work on issues unrelated to their earlier jobs.

Well, that was a stupid thing to say to begin with. Most lobbyists have worked in or held government positions and vice versa. It's almost impossible to find a "pristine" person in Washington. Colin Powell can be considered a military lobbyist, ffs.
