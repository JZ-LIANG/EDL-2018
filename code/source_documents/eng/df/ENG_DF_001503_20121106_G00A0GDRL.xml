President Prediction Time

I will start it off:

Obama 300 Electoral College

Draw for popular votes. Well within 1%. Romney might have the edge not that it matters.

If all votes were cast tomorrow I'd say Romney. With all the early voting edge to Obama. It will be very hard for Obama to claim any type of "Mandate" if he loses the popular vote, even if he takes the Electoral College.

Obama around 303-05

<post author="HarryTheSpider" datetime="2012-11-06T03:51:00" id="p4">
Obama -&gt; 307 electoral votes
</post>
<post author="RoadWarriorFromLP" datetime="2012-11-06T08:03:00" id="p5">
Electoral College - Obama (277-332; Likely: 281, 290 or 303)

Popular vote - Obama (spread of 1-2%)

(I am less confident about the popular vote than the electoral vote; Romney winning the popular vote by a slight margin is not beyond the realm of possibility.)

277+ for Obama. Try it here and see...

I disagree. The president is the president, and the electoral college is the system we have.

Obama by at least 290 EVs and probably at least 303. If he goes as low as 277 I'll be gobsmacked.

Civic duty performed, and hoping I won't have to emigrate again.

I'm in Illinois though, so presumably not a hotly contested state for Obama.

Hmm.. Dixville Notch voted five for Obama and five for Romney, maybe we'll have the Romney-Biden scenario..

That makes no sense whatsoever.

Having Obama win via electoral college votes and not by the popular vote would be a wonderful irony.

That's a good start, but remember the old adage; vote early and often.

Jeesh, sorry if this makes me religionist but I wouldn't want a mormon president, gives me the creeps. Certainly not one with a 25 million dollar tax freeish income.

Got my citizenship application going just in case! Although, as my son reminded me - I said I'd leave if Bush got re-elected and I didn't. Was talking to someone the other day and she commented : At least you have somewhere to go.

Wish I'd done the citizenship sooner so I could vote as it could go either way in CO.

Keeping my fingers crossed you call it correctly Sally! Not sure I can withstand 4yrs of RWNJs running things.

Hate to say this, but that's how I felt when I went to bed late on election day in 2004... then Ohio dirty tricks happened..

Prediction:

Tied in the electoral college. Tied in the popular vote.

It goes to congress to decide and we have yet ANOTHER tie.

Choices:

1) Draw Straws
2) Rocks Paper Scissors
3) Thumb Wrestling
4) Celebrity Death Match
