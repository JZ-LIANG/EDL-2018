Are we to blame for Bangladesh factory collapse?

Seems the factory supplied companies like Primark and the Spanish firm Mango.
Is it the companies fault for not demanding safer working conditions in their suppliers. Or is it our fault for choosing the cheaper option when we purchase?

It has everything to do with the fact that loads of factories in China, India etc, are unsafe anyway, and have multiple factories crammed into a single multistorey buildings.

Although Primark etc do make money by using these sweatshops, the local businessmen also make money and they don´t seem to care about the safety aspect of the local workers when considering their profits.

Surely as the workers were not employed by Primark, then the employer (probably local) should be held responsible, because even if there was no Primark contract the building would still have been used to make cheap clothing for another company.

......and the govt for not exercising proper building regulations.

I wouldn't imagine for one moment that those responsible for controlling building standards would ever dream of turning a blind eye to a little corner cutting in return for the odd back hander. <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/cool.gif"/>

in answer to the basic question NO!!

if you start taking personal responsibility for everything at all subcontractors, suppliers etc then you will drive yourself into an early grave.

being a shareholder in the company you buy from may give you some different "responsibilities" but until then...........

keep buying, there are others who will be looking over the shoulders of those who are cutting corners.

Sorry Dom the answer is YES

We should be buying British made goods and keeping down our benefits bill.

Or Spanish made

must disagree Fred, you are behind the times, the UK has little or no manufacturing facilities for these goods, the buyers from the retail shops would never think to "buy local", the price would be too high
just watch Coronation Street.

Perhaps is it is these buyers who should take the blame, they should be ensuring the correct standards are maintained
but we know the couldn'g give a shit so long as the price is LOW
just remember that every item sold in the uk high street for £5 is costing less than £1.00. It is called profit. And when they have a 50% of sale at the end of the season they are still making at least 100% profit.

so, you want the little girly shopping at Zavvi or similar to become worried about the conditions the workers have to work, live, even die in. No Chance. they are not interested, if it is 50p dearer than New Look they will show no loyalty whatsoever, just go their.

and as to Fashion, that is lead by similarly empty headed buyers who decide the market, show no loyalty to a given factory, to a group of workers.
the profit is the name of the game

sorry, I can have no responsibility for the actions of others in such a dog eat dog world.

It isn't just the cheap high street brands who have their products manufactured in countries where working conditions are appalling, though:-

It's all about maximising profit, at whatever price-point in the market they are.

on the back, poorly stamped (by hand ??) Made in China

Absolutely correct Dom, but that does not alter the fact that we should be buying British, Spanish or even European.

I agree but it's not always possible and there is a cut off point where price becomes an issue.

I have always bought British made (built?) cars and only allow my staff company cars made in Europe.
