While I do not doubt that this is possible, a part of me can't help remembering the WMD claim on Iraq and the blood on Bliar's hands over Dr. Kelly.

Another Western intervention into a Middle Eastern war looms, I think...

Unfortunately, your predictions could all too likely become reality, which is both frightening and saddening.

I hope you're wrong, but....

There wont be any western intervention in Syria due to the alleged use of chemical weapons. This claim has been raised by Israel a little while ago. However there was a lack of evidence - most chemical weapons kill within a short space of time - you usually would not have managed to get pics of someone suffering in hospital and taken pics as evidence on the field would be more obvious. Possibly Israel is more concerned with defending another border.

Recently Israel was saying that if they have intelligence that Assad's chemical weapons will fall into the wrong hands (eg: AQ &amp; Hez), they will take action. So does this mean then that it Assad's hands are not considered "wrong hands".

This all seems like a convenient excuse for the West,Turkey and Gulfies to enter the fray and install a Sunni regime. Could be a flase flag; i.e. Mossad and or Rebels introduce a substance to a limited area that causes people to exhibit signs claimed to be from chemical weapons.

Could also be true. Assad maybee on the ropes so has to resort to more deadly weapons. It is surreal how the Western powers warn him they will intervene if he uses chemical weapons but the reason he may use them is because Western powers are supporting the rebels.

Israel won't do anything.
"The West" won't do anything.

Both will sit back and watch and wait for Syria to burn itself out. Particularly as it gives very useful information as to who is coming in from abroad to "freedom" fight.

Israel is feeling the pressure - they are buggered if Assad goes down as the rebels may turn the weapons onto them, which means them defending another border. They are also concerned with Lebanon and border skirmishes. Their best bet is that Assad quashes the rebels - however he is on a losing wicket, or to "persuade" the US to intervene.

The pressure is on Assad to end this - the West wont get involved as there is no profit.

The loonies will take over. Did anyone really believe all this BS about "The Arab Spring" ? Bearded Jihadists from all corners of the Globe have been heading there for months. aided by the West and Allies.
