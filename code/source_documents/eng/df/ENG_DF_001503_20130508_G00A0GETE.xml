It is horrifying, every report I read the toll gets higher. Heartbreakingly sad, and I can't help thinking that every one of those people left so many others who loved them and will grieve for them.

The real cost of cheap clothing. I wonder how many people would be happy paying the increased price for more ethically sound manufacturing?

There's nothing stopping people buying "ethically sound" clothing if they wish to do so.

Whilst this whole thing is a terrible tragedy it's not cheap clothes that caused it it was diabolical/non existent building regulations.

I agree - nobody is forced to buy cheap clothes. Where's the blame on the Bangledeshi government/authorities in all this?

I see that one of BE's darling 'superior' UK retailers, Primark sourced garments from a factory in this building. What cost those GBPeso1 t-shirts?

A few things to understand: The population of Bangladesh is 160m in an area smaller than that of Victoria. It's basically all around sea level, and gets hit by monsoon and typoon. Everyone except the 1% are extremely poor, all agencies are corrupt, and realistically, people are disposable. Actually it's more than that, people are a problem. When China was in the early stage of growth it took many of the clothes manufacturing contracts from Bangladesh, depressing the industry and the economy and closing factories. Now they have moved on to making high value goods, those contracts are moving back, and factories are being expanded to cope. Couple the corruption, the growth and the disposable populous, and people will get crammed into the cheapest building, themselves built by the cheapest workers - and everyone will skim from the top, bottom and sides. 'Standards', whether Bangladesh government, western brand labels, or factory owner - are unlikely to make much difference, even if they were raised - someone would skim money off by doing a cheap job and swearing blind they had done everything to standard. If you took the contracts away, you'd just have more workers starving and out of work.

Some excellent points here. Also, it's worth remembering that the terrible conditions described in Bangladesh were experienced by British workers during the industrial revolution, as Britain transformed from agrarian to industrial power. It's something all first world countries went through on their way up.
