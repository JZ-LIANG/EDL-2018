And John McCain,the ever faithfull NeoCon servant, makes a secret trip to Syria to meet the Rebels.

So we got Western Europe and the US effectively supporting Al Qaeda / Salafists in Syria. Guess they are only "terrorists" sometimes...

The Sunni rebels have gone on the record to state there will be ethnic cleansing of Shia but the West supports them. Oh and you know there will fsdalso be ethnic cleansing of Christians because Christians are already being cleansed from certain areas by the Sunni rebels.

So US (and presumably to to follow, UK &amp; France) to arm the rebels.

Nerve gas used...

Russia, Tehran and Hezbollah on Assad side...

93,000 dead so far...

Israel looking twitchy and Lebanon shaky...

This conflict has a long, long way to go...

The NATO-GCC-Israel axis thought Assad was done for but with Hez's help he routed the Sunni rebels + AQ, so NATO needs an excuse to justify helping the Rebels; enter alleged Sarin use by Assad.

If ever there was a sentence to chill the blood - that was it (except you didn't mention Russia).

So you agree (mostly) or disagree with what I said?

Russia doesn't appear to be helping Assad to the extent the aforementioned 3 are helping the Rebels; they deny sending the S300. The major Russian help (along with China) appears limited to supporting Assad in the UN.

Whatever happens we can be sure we'll be blamed by liberals, fundamentalists and whoever else already hates us.

It's not in Israel's interests to see the Assad Government fall. A stable and secular Syria would eventually come to the table with them (especially once Iran moderates).

I too think Israel would be worse off with the Salafi Saudi/Qatari supported Sunni rebels BUT it does appear that interventionist pro Israel forces lean towards NATO ousting Assad.

Below article first published on the 16th of June. In it, Israeli Haifa University academic purported to be an expert on a the MidEast warns that Assad is winning and that's bad for Israel.

Whether the headline is actually going to happen, debatable...

Interesting article though...
