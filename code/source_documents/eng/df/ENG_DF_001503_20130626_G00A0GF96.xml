I've heard the army has started to take over and secure some cities and airports and the president is preparing to make a speech. Petrol in short supply and people are stocking up in food as demonstrations are happening on 30th June.

Just left there yesterday, petrol and diesel are in very short supply. There were queues kilometres long into some of the petrol stations in Cairo along the ring road.

There is a very low number of petrol stations in the city in general anyhow compared to the size of the population.

Anyhow will be interesting to see if anything actually happens on the 30th, could be the usual amount of hot air and stone throwing but not much else.

I think it will start tomorrow or maybe even tonight. The people are so excited and Mosi has a speech to do this evening...Army taking sides with the protestors. Super stuff.

At least it delays the project I've been working on - something I've been asking the client to do but it happens naturally now <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

I know many Egyptians who want the same. A good friend of mine wants a famine to hit the country* - their view is that without hitting rock bottom they cannot get up.

* which isn't that unlikely - given that they import 40% of their food and have no money. If the Nile is damned then they'll have to import more too.

If I was an Egyptian, I would agree with this.

Egypt is a desert supported by water from the Nile. They are the largest population and have built their way of life (rightly or wrongly) based on water from it.

Damning it up stream would be like taking away the UK's ability to import oil. Going to war would make sense.

Problem is that damn is partially financed and constructed by the Chinese. I can't see the Egyptians really coming out of that fight.

From what I can gather most Egyptians are pissed of with morsi. Even pro Muslim brotherhood taxi drivers were looking forward to the protest as they want morsi to resign.
Egypt is deeply ****ed to the point the government are making grand communist style claims about a bumper wheat crop magically up 30% in a year when farmers are complaining that they have record low harvests.

Always a good indicator that things are ****ed when Stalinist or tactics are being used

The old treaty completely screwed every other country and I can't say I blame them for wanting to change things. Could be the first water war of many to come though
