Putting aside the geo-political posturings/history of Venezuela and USA, its interesting that Venezuela has offered assylum to Snowden.

Interested in the general opinion, Question is
He is a traitor that revealed national security secrets that lead to the deaths or risked the lives of US citizens. His passport is revoked and he must stand trial
He is a political asylum seeker, who wont get a fair trial in the US, and he is in danger if he returns. He has a right to assylum, especially after all the efforts the US have gone to get him.
I'm not sure. I like the idea of passport revoking... in very special cases. And Qatada played the system for years to stay and protect his 'rights'.

Daily we accept political asylum seekers as they are safer in our country. Normally we see the country of origin as some despot controlled place, not the US, but doesn't the same principle apply?

Hero/Traitor - the big debate. He for sure signed the equivalent of the official secrets act and for sure he knew he was doing wrong taking info out as he did.

Clearly a traitor.

Also a complete Hypocrite to seek shelter in countries that have worse snooping, secrecy and spying records than the country he just left behind and is complaining about.

Makes me wonder just how genuine are his motives or if there is a bit more to it than meets the eye.

Yes, Traitor. Matters not which country he came from. They are all heavily involved in spying. He should rot in some despot country along with Assange.

Vile is the man who cannot love his country.

So to paraphrase the first 2

1. He IS Traitor
2. He IS allowed Asylum, OK, and if he wants to go to those sorts of countries... good riddance.... don't come back (can't anyway no passport)

Let's see how this pans out.....

obviously he thinks he knows something nobody else does and doesn't know the background of those countries he seems so desperate to drop anchor.

I just can't understand why he appears to suddenly popped up out of nowhere (so far as we are concerned) but it is usual for such people to show signs of drifting "from the path" and been subject to more and more security reviews with his access to information restricted to nothing.
his online cv indicates he has a history of not finishing things he started and bending the truth as to his past education and work.
Those who carried out and maintained his vetting will probably join the retired, if not already done so.
Probably find he is a Walter Mitty character and although he has sent the shivers up the spine for a few people, that some of this will actually be a load of old tosh.

People's attitude to security matters have changed over recent years.
those who worked at Bletchley Park have had difficulty acknowledging they worked there to their wife/husband, letalone the things they were told they couldn't talk about. Their commitment to the nation and its security should be more recognised.
