So awful to read about the devastation this has caused. My heart goes out to everyone effected. I hope all our BE members are safe

Likewise. Just stopped by this board to say I hope everyone is okay and to stay safe.

There are loads of Pinoys in the UAE, so we're all concerned here.

I have only just joined this site but I was there in Malapascua for 3 weeks helping the locals clearing the trees and rebuilding their houses. Such a beautiful place before and give it time it will recover. I am going back to Philippines in March for 1 month scuba diving
