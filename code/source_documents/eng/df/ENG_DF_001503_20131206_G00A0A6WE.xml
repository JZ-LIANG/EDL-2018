I have been awaiting a thread and comment from someone, anyone, on his passing.

Seems we can do Flight of the Concords or whatever it is, but not this.

RIP Nelson Mandela.

Yours was a long and complicated move towards a sense of freedom for all.

Indeed, RIP Mandela, cometh the hour cometh the man and he certainly did his bit at that time. However Gandhi achieved similar without violence, and I think F W de Klerk was the real unsung hero of the end of apartheid.

A freedom fighter now free from the confines of his physical life.

RIP Mandela, Kia Kaha South Africa.

Lots of posts in the 'Lounge' Obit thread.

But I have to say he was a truly great man, and well deserved all the awards he got, especially the Nobel Peace prize.

Very sad news.

A truly great man, he will be sorely missed. RIP Madiba

Quite. The fact that he was also a terrorist seems to have been forgotten.

I felt the same. not really knowing much about his early life, really should go download a book, but thought he was cited for organising armed action and more.
But then I read a book that called Jesus a terrorist so looks like both made good in the end <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

Just watched a programme on the BBC about his like, and yes he organised 'terrorist' attacks, but they were confined to blowing up power pylons and attacking government and police buildings but attacking people wasn't part of the plan, however while he was in prison, young members of the ANC did escalate the action. This was mainly in response to the Soweto massacre, but there was tribal rivalry between the ANC and Incarta, however Mandela was on Robben Island at that time.

ahh the little that I read said he was involved in planning armed action and a conspiracy to help other countries invade South Africa.

An interesting interpretation by Mishal Husain:

Having studied the history of apartheid in South Africa in school it seemed to me a long list of massacres:

I dug out some other quotes:

For me, his greatest achievements happened after he left prison. Along with De Klerk, he deserved his Nobel Peace Prize.

For me two wrongs don't make a right. But that is just my opinion. I can well understand the anger that black people must've felt under the abhorrent regime of apartheid. I'm so pleased that Nelson Mandela, went on to live the life he did after his release from prison.

Jesus is a moot point as there is no proof that he ever existed.

The world has lost a great man but on the plus side his family have kept him alive long enough
to put each and every one of them in the public eye ensuring they can milk this to line their
pockets for years to come....nice one !!
