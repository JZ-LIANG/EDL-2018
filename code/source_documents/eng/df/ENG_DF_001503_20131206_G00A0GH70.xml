The victors always get to write the history. As far as I'm concerned he was just another terrorist.

Seeing so many 'bleeding hearts' and outpouring of grief at the death of this self confessed terrorist, bomber and murderer of the innocents, makes me wonder what will happen when that other much admired 'freedom fighter' Martin Mcguiness finally pops his clogs...a state funeral perhaps ? <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/rofl.gif"/>

I partly agree but sometimes, however difficult it can be, you have to deal with bad people to make things happen for the common good

It can be a bitch but there it is

That's the way its always been

a pretty selective article but then I guess it will please its target audience. On the subject of being friends with dictators, you do realise that in order to defeat one dictator, Hitler, your nation allied itself with an even bigger dictator, Stalin?

Sometimes you gotta deal with the devil

Personally I'd rather "deal with them" then have dealings with them.

Political leaders are all murdering bastards. It's what they do. All the little Thatcherites that wanted to hang Mandela were quick enough at voting her in. She was no pacifist.

What absolute garbage and please don't mention Mcguiness in the same breath as Mandela.
Whatever the ANC did was justified by the introduction of apartheid.
Whatever happens in SA at least it will be decided by the vast majority that are indigenous to that region. A lot of Yarpies didn't get the kicking they probably deserved.
