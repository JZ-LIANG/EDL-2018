I guess that there will shortly be other riots, looting and violence for immediate membership of the EU. Amazing that the EU condones mob violence in the Ukraine but not in their own countries..................

Seriously?

The conflict is about 100s of years of history where Russians have controlled, dominated and starved the Ukrainian population.

Most ethnic Ukranians want to break away from Russia, quite understandably given the way that they have always been treated by them

However, there are also lots of ethnic Russians in the Ukraine, including the current president, who are controlled and bribed by Putin.

Russia doesnt want to lose the Ukraine to the EU as it is critical for their plans to return as a global superpower, but many Ukranians equate the EU to freedom

This conflict has the potential to end in a serious and horrible civil war

Your'e right. The EU doesn't like dissent - it likes control. Bit of a paradox.

The President has shut down newspapers and tv stations, made previously legal protesting illegal and sent the Paramilitary police in to deal with protestors and it's the protestors that are to blame... Interesting. Malcolm X was right when he wrote those prophetic words....

I don't know who is to blame but since when does a mob in a City square become a majority. <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/confused.gif"/> We have seen it happen in many places over the past few years and it always ends in violence on both sides. There seems to be an automatic assumption in the media that Protesters are always right.

Best way forward would be to have an election.

Well if you call them a mob then you have already made your mind up <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/thumbdown.gif"/>

They are people fighting for their democratic rights. And actually the demonstrations were entirely peaceful until the police started setting their tents on fire while they were still in them!

Just as in Spain, and in a smaller part, in London. The police are the mobs who go around violenting distributing "justice". The worst thing of all is that they are instructed to do so by the politicians.

The concept of democracy is been lost across Europe. Every day, we have fewer and fewer rights. It is the price to pay to ensure the status quo i.e. the rich must remain rich at any human cost

It's a mob when they start taking over and occupying government buildings. There are also many far right groups involved. Don't forget this country has a history of internal fighting. Perhaps both sides are wrong.

If I were Ukranian and knowing the history of Russian relations with the Ukraine, then absolutely I would be occupying government buildings

Any rational person would be

As history has proved so many times ( just look at Jugoslavia ) you cannot manufacture countries and expect the different regions and political structures to co exist without conflict.
The Crimea wants to rejoin Russia, the western Ukraine has close historical ties with Poland and western Europe,
Russian intervention is the great fear they now have.
This came from a Ukrainian we met this lunchtime.

I think you're a bit of a lone voice here. Most of us seem all in favour of Scottish Independence.
