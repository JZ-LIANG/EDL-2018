(    O
such    O
as    O
iOS    O

because    O
of    O
its    O

the    O
platform    O
was    O
criticized    O
for    O
its    O
poor    O
software    O
ecosystem    O
,    O
citing    O
the    O
early    O
state    O
of    O

and    O
its    O
incompatibility    O

a    O

approach    O

ARM    O

x86    O
,    O
though    O
,    O
not    O

because    O
of    O
the    O
number    O
of    O

noted    O
that    O
the    O
