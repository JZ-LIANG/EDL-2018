As    O
a    O
result    O
of    O
these    O
studies    O
,    O
Wallis    O
conceived    O
of    O
more    O
effective    O
means    O
to    O
use    O
explosives    O
;    O
that    O
the    O
shock    O
wave    O
that    O
was    O
created    O
when    O
munitions    O
such    O
as    O
depth    O
charges    O
were    O
detonated    O
was    O
more    O
damaging    O
than    O
the    O
initial    O
blast    O
of    O
the    O
detonation    O
itself    O
;    O
he    O
also    O
viewed    O
conventional    O
bombing    O
methods    O
as    O
practised    O
by    O
RAF    B-AirForce108196024
Bomber    I-AirForce108196024
Command    I-AirForce108196024
to    O
be    O
insufficient    O
on    O
these    O
terms    O
to    O
attack    O
dispersed    O
industrial    O
areas    O
.    O

Wallis    O
argued    O
that    O
roughly    O
4,000    O
acres    O
could    O
be    O
thoroughly    O
destroyed    O
by    O
five    O
aircraft    O
each    O
deploying    O
only    O
a    O
single    O
such    O
bomb    O
;    O
this    O
would    O
allow    O
for    O
far    O
greater    O
levels    O
of    O
destruction    O
by    O
RAF    B-AirForce108196024
Bomber    I-AirForce108196024
Command    I-AirForce108196024
as    O
it    O
required    O
substantially    O
fewer    O
bombers    O
to    O
create    O
the    O
same    O
levels    O
of    O
damage    O
as    O
via    O
contemporary    O
means    O
.    O

As    O

The    O
