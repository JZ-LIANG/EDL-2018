It    O
was    O
becoming    O
obvious    O
to    O
the    O

that    O
,    O
even    O
with    O

the    O

be    O
obsolete    O
by    O
the    O
time    O
it    O
entered    O
production    O
and    O
would    O
offer    O

;    O
as    O
a    O
result    O
,    O
the    O
entire    O

was    O
postponed    O
for    O
six    O
months    O
.    O

Some    O
general    O
interest    O
continued    O
until    O
the    O
early    O
1950s    O
but    O
designs    O
did    O
not    O
necessarily    O
offer    O
a    O
great    O
advantage    O
in    O
range    O
and    O
presented    O
a    O
number    O
of    O
technical    O
problems    O
,    O
leading    O
to    O
the    O
adoption    O
of    O
"    O
conventional    O
