side    O

For    O
example    O

the    O
principle    O

by    O
Thomas    B-Apologist109798534

,    O
holds    O
that    O
actions    O
with    O
both    O
good    O
and    O
bad    O
consequences    O
are    O
morally    O
acceptable    O
in    O
specific    O
circumstances    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
question    O

The    O
importance    O
of    O

The    O
Christian    O
rhetor    O
Lactantius    B-Apologist109798534
suggested    O
that    O
Maximian    O
shared    O
Diocletian    O
's    O
basic    O
attitudes    O
but    O
was    O
less    O
puritanical    O
in    O
his    O
tastes    O
,    O
and    O
took    O
advantage    O
of    O
the    O
sensual    O
opportunities    O
his    O
position    O
as    O
emperor    O
offered    O
.    O

Lactantius    B-Apologist109798534
argued    O
that    O
Aurelian    O
would    O
have    O
outlawed    O
all    O
the    O
other    O
gods    O
if    O
he    O
had    O
had    O
enough    O
time    O
,    O
but    O
Aurelian    O
only    O
managed    O
to    O
hold    O
on    O
to    O
the    O
position    O
of    O
Emperor    O
for    O
five    O
years    O

to    O
the    O
religion    O
of    O
the    O

,    O
provides    O
an    O
approximate    O
translation    O
of    O
Julian    O
the    O
Apostate    O
's    O
purported    O
quotation    O
of    O
Trajan    O
:    O

In    O
1710    O
he    O
edited    O
the    O
"    O
Liber    O
ad    O
Donatum    O
confessorem    O
de    O
mortibus    O
persecutorum    O
"    O
,    O
and    O
in    O
a    O
special    O
dissertation    O
tries    O
hard    O
to    O
prove    O
that    O
the    O
book    O
was    O
written    O
by    O
Lucius    O
Caecilius    O
and    O
not    O
by    O
Lactantius    B-Apologist109798534
.    O

It    O
is    O
primarily    O
based    O
on    O
the    O
now    O
lost    O
Latin    O
"    O
Passio    O
sanctorum    O
Fidis    O
et    O
Caprisii    O
"    O
,    O
though    O
seven    O
Latin    O
sources    O
have    O
been    O
identified    O
,    O
including    O
the    O
"    O
De    B-Apologist109798534
mortibus    I-Apologist109798534
persecutorum    I-Apologist109798534
"    O
of    O
Lactantius    B-Apologist109798534

The    O
body    O
of    O

said    O
to    O
be    O
buried    O
under    O
the    O
main    O
altar    O
.    O

Though    O
that    O
may    O
be    O
so    O
according    O
to    O
the    O
genealogy    O
laid    O
out    O
by    O
Hesiod    O
's    O
"    O
Theogony    O
"    O
,    O
it    O
has    O
been    O
pointed    O
out    O
that    O
Milton    O
could    O
well    O
have    O
used    O
alternate    O
sources    O
,    O
such    O
as    O
Lactantius    B-Apologist109798534
's    O
"    O
Divinae    O
Institutiones    O
"    O
(    O
"    O
Divine    O
Institutes    O
"    O
)    O
,    O
which    O
quotes    O
Ennius    O
to    O
the    O
effect    O
that    O
Uranus    O
had    O
two    O
sons    O
,    O
Titan    O
and    O
Saturn    O
.    O

The    O
condemnation    O
of    O
suicide    O
is    O
reflected    O
in    O
the    O
teachings    O
of    O
Clement    O
of    O
Alexandria    O
,    O
Lactantius    B-Apologist109798534
,    O
St.    O
Augustine    O
and    O
others    O
.    O

According    O
to    O
the    O
Christian    O
writer    O
Lactantius    B-Apologist109798534
,    O
"    O
in    O
addition    O
to    O
the    O

off    O

clothing    O

act    O
as    O
mimes    O
in    O
full    O
view    O
of    O
the    O
crowd    O
,    O
and    O
this    O
they    O
continue    O
until    O
full    O
satiety    O
comes    O
to    O
the    O
shameless    O
lookers    O
-    O
on    O
,    O
holding    O
their    O
attention    O
with    O
their    O
wriggling    O
buttocks    O
.    O
"    O

The    O
early    O
Christian    O
author    O
Lactantius    B-Apologist109798534
claimed    O
that    O
Diocletian    O
's    O
reforms    O
led    O
to    O
widespread    O
economic    O
stagnation    O
,    O
since    O
"    O
the    O
provinces    O
were    O
divided    O
into    O
minute    O
portions    O
,    O
and    O
many    O
presidents    O
and    O
a    O
multitude    O
of    O
inferior    O
officers    O
lay    O
heavy    O
on    O
each    O
territory    O
.    O
"    O

Until    O
the    O
end    O
of    O
the    O
3rd    O
century    O
,    O
the    O
main    O
genre    O
was    O
apologetics    O
(    O
justifications    O
of    O
Christianity    O
)    O
,    O
by    O
writers    O
such    O
as    O
Minucius    B-Apologist109798534

and    O
Lactantius    B-Apologist109798534
.    O

The    O
same    O
account    O
is    O
often    O
compared    O
to    O
Lactantius    B-Apologist109798534
,    O
which    O
provides    O
a    O
radically    O
different    O
depiction    O
of    O
the    O
same    O
story    O

early    O
Christian    O
scholars    O
such    O
as    O
Lactantius    B-Apologist109798534
,    O
John    O
Chrysostom    O
and    O
Athanasius    O
of    O

Lactantius    B-Apologist109798534
also    O
maintained    O
that    O
exposing    O
a    O

to    O
death    O
was    O
a    O
wicked    O
act    O

In    O
this    O
,    O
he    O
relies    O
on    O
earlier    O
Christian    O
writings    O

to    O
the    O

appeared    O
in    O

may    O
also    O
be    O
mentioned    O

is    O
that    O
Joseph    O
was    O
the    O
husband    O
of    O

,    O
but    O
that    O
references    O
to    O

be    O

brothers    O

Jerome    B-Apologist109798534
wrote    O
the    O
same    O
:    O
"    O
James    O
...    O

"    O
and    O
that    O
James    O
"    O

thirty    O
years    O

main    O
sources    O
for    O
the    O
life    O
of    O

are    O
the    O

Pauline    O
epistles    O

Jerome    B-Apologist109798534
,    O
who    O
also    O
quote    O
the    O
early    O
Christian    O
chronicler    O
Hegesippus    O
and    O
Epiphanius    O
.    O

Jerome    B-Apologist109798534
believed    O
that    O
the    O
"    O
brothers    O
"    O
of    O
the    O
Lord    O
were    O
Jesus    O

,    O
thus    O
amplifying    O
the    O
doctrine    O
of    O
perpetual    O
virginity    O
.    O

According    O
to    O
Jerome    B-Apologist109798534
,    O
James    O
,    O
the    O
Lord    O
’s    O
brother    O
,    O
was    O
an    O
apostle    O
,    O
too    O
;    O
Jerome    O
quotes    O
Scriptures    O
as    O
a    O
proof    O
in    O
his    O
work    O
"    O
The    O
Perpetual    O
Virginity    O
of    O
Blessed    O
Mary    O
"    O
,    O
writing    O
the    O
following    O
:    O

Jerome    B-Apologist109798534
asserts    O
in    O
his    O
tract    O
"    O
The    O
Perpetual    O
Virginity    O
of    O
Blessed    O
Mary    O
"    O
,    O
as    O
an    O
answer    O
to    O
Helvidius    O
,    O
that    O
the    O
term    O
"    O
first    O
-    O
born    O
"    O
was    O
used    O
to    O
refer    O
to    O
any    O
offspring    O
that    O
opened    O
the    O
womb    O
,    O
rather    O
than    O
definitely    O
implying    O
other    O
children    O

is    O
considered    O
an    O
important    O
document    O
of    O
the    O

of    O

This    O
conversion    O
is    O
contested    O
by    O
the    O
Christian    O
writers    O
Jerome    B-Apologist109798534
and    O
Eusebius    O
,    O
who    O
state    O
that    O
Ammonius    O
remained    O
a    O
Christian    O
throughout    O
his    O
lifetime    O

to    O
his    O
contemporary    O
,    O

Even    O
before    O
the    O
Council    O
of    O
Ephesus    O
,    O
he    O
defended    O
the    O
Ever    O
-    O
Virgin    O
Mary    O
as    O
the    O
Mother    O
of    O
God    O
,    O
believing    O
her    O
to    O
be    O
"    O
full    O
of    O
grace    O

of    O
her    O

integrity    O

innocence    O
.    O

This    O
is    O
because    O

believed    O
that    O
the    O

of    O

that    O

a    O
late    O
fourth    O

Latin    O
translation    O
of    O
the    O

from    O
its    O
original    O
languages    O

largely    O
the    O
work    O
of    O
St.    B-Apologist109798534

to    O

theologian    O
Herbert    O

this    O

was    O
also    O
considered    O
(    O

eventually    O
rejected    O
)    O
as    O
a    O
possibility    O
by    O
Jerome    B-Apologist109798534
,    O
who    O
noted    O
it    O
as    O
an    O
aside    O
in    O
his    O
commentary    O
to    O
Matthew    O

all    O
