By    O
constructing    O
aqueduct    B-Aqueduct102732433
,    O
the    O
Romans    O
had    O
enough    O

for    O
domestic    O

paused    O

an    O
important    O
role    O
in    O
this    O

the    O

the    O

,    O
King    O
John    O
V    O
,    O
ordered    O
the    O
construction    O
of    O
an    O
aqueduct    B-Aqueduct102732433
to    O
transport    O
water    O
from    O
the    O
parish    O
of    O
Caneças    O
to    O
the    O
city    O
of    O
Lisbon    O
,    O
which    O
suffered    O
from    O
chronic    O
lack    O
of    O
water    O
.    O

There    O
are    O
also    O
traces    O
of    O
an    O

He    O
added    O
new    O
pools    O
and    O
fountains    O
to    O
the    O
complex    O
,    O
and    O
regenerated    O
the    O
aqueduct    B-Aqueduct102732433
that    O
,    O
in    O
earlier    O
years    O
,    O
had    O
fed    O
the    O
garden    O
with    O
fresh    O
water    O
.    O

In    O
1523    O
,    O
a    O
great    O
fountain    O
was    O
built    O
,    O
in    O
1541    O
,    O
the    O
school    O
was    O
built    O
,    O
in    O
1564    O
,    O
a    O
town    O
hall    O
was    O
built    O
on    O
the    O
marketplace    O
,    O
and    O
in    O
1587    O
,    O
the    O
first    O
aqueduct    B-Aqueduct102732433
was    O
built    O
using    O
wooden    O

constructed    O
in    O
the    O

and    O
electric    O

used    O
to    O

He    O

The    O

Colorado    O
River    O
water    O
from    O

,    O

Near    O
Tunis    O
,    O
the    O

Goletta    O
was    O
later    O
occupied    O
by    O
Spanish    O
forces    O
who    O
built    O
there    O
a    O
large    O
and    O
strong    O
presidio    O
;    O
they    O
also    O
constructed    O
an    O
aqueduct    B-Aqueduct102732433
to    O

for    O
