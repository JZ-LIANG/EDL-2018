Perhaps    O
the    O
most    O
celebrated    O
example    O
of    O
this    O
occurred    O
on    O
17    O
November    O
1558    O
,    O
when    O
several    O
Protestant    O
heretics    O
were    O
tied    O
to    O
their    O
stakes    O
in    O
Smithfield    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
firewood    O
bundles    O
were    O
about    O
to    O
be    O
lit    O
when    O
a    O
royal    O
messenger    O
rode    O
up    O
to    O
announce    O
that    O
Mary    B-Archduchess109804518
I    I-Archduchess109804518
had    O
died    O

that    O
the    O

lost    O
their    O
force    O

,    O
daughters    O
of    O
Henry    O

on    O

,    O
possibly    O
,    O
as    O

has    O
also    O
been    O
identified    O
with    O

of    I-Archduchess109804518

your    O

said    O
to    O
refer    O
to    O
her    O
lack    O
of    O
heirs    O
,    O

to    O
the    O
common    O

of    O

The    O
title    O
was    O
forfeited    O
in    O
1554    O
after    O
the    O

restored    O
in    O

was    O
because    O

viewed    O
this    O

as    O
an    O
evil    O

he    O
had    O
her    O
accused    O
of    O
engaging    O
in    O
illicit    O
sexual    O
acts    O
with    O
five    O
men    O
and    O
fostered    O
rumors    O
that    O
she    O
had    O
afflicted    O
him    O
with    O
impotence    O

wife    O
of    O
the    O
conquistador    O
Pedro    O
de    O
Alvarado    O
.    O

The    O
king    O
of    O
Denmark    O
had    O
first    O
intended    O
to    O
marry    O
her    O
eldest    O
sister    O
Eleanor    B-Archduchess109804518
of    I-Archduchess109804518
Austria    I-Archduchess109804518
,    O
but    O
the    O
Habsburgs    O
considered    O
Eleanor    O
too    O
valuable    O
for    O
the    O
throne    O
of    O
Denmark    O
,    O
because    O
as    O
the    O
eldest    O
sister    O
,    O
there    O
was    O
a    O
likelihood    O
that    O
her    O
progeny    O
may    O
succeed    O
.    O

She    O
is    O
pictured    O
with    O
her    O
brother    O
Charles    O
and    O
her    O
sister    O
Eleanor    B-Archduchess109804518
.    O

Therefore    O
,    O
the    O
emperor    O
acted    O
quickly    O
and    O
selected    O
three    O
suitable    O
candidates    O
for    O
Sigismund    O
:    O
his    O
granddaughter    O
