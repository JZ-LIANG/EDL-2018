in    O

in    O

In    O
1594    O
and    O
1595    O
he    O
and    O

The    O
legitimacy    O
of    O
the    O
succession    O
was    O
recognised    O
by    O
the    O
Emperor    B-Archduke109804658
Rudolph    I-Archduke109804658

but    O
not    O
by    O
Pope    O
Clement    O
VIII    O
:    O
thus    O
,    O
as    O
Ferrara    O
was    O
nominally    O
a    O
Papal    O
fief    O
,    O
the    O
city    O
was    O
returned    O
to    O
the    O

,    O
despite    O
the    O
attempts    O
of    O
the    O

sought    O

the    O
major    O
powers    O
to    O
no    O
avail    O

The    O
year    O
1576    O
was    O
very    O
important    O
,    O
when    O

now    O

he    O
instead    O
applied    O
in    O

refused    O
to    O
mediate    O
the    O
conflict    O

and    O
so    O
Henry    O

—    O

convert    O
to    O

intervened    O
in    O
1593    O
.    O

Some    O
years    O
of    O
his    O
life    O
were    O
passed    O
at    O
the    O

he    O
was    O
a    O
great    O
favorite    O

by    O
whom    O
he    O
was    O
knighted    O

However    O
,    O
the    O
rule    O
over    O

was    O
short    O

on    O
grounds    O
of    O
doubtful    O
legitimacy    O

He    O
was    O
also    O
a    O
member    O
of    O

next    O
settled    O
in    O
Bohemia    O
in    O
1591    O
,    O
and    O
was    O
at    O

for    O
two    O
years    O
only    O
,    O
as    O
in    O
1593    O
he    O
was    O
commissioned    O
to    O

some    O

antique    O
for    O
the    O

and    O
for    O
that    O

went    O
to    O

where    O
he    O
spent    O
some    O
years    O

deposed    O
all    O

office    O
holders    O
in    O

even    O
went    O
as    O
far    O
as    O
expelling    O
them    O
from    O
the    O

The    O
change    O
,    O
according    O
to    O
the    O
chroniclers    O
,    O
was    O
linked    O
to    O
the    O
Battle    O
of    O
the    O
Schosshalde    O
in    O

After    O
a    O

,    O
they    O
reached    O
Prague    O
in    O
Bohemia    O
in    O
the    O
autumn    O
of    O
1600    O

where    O

met    O
with    O

Since    O
1930    O
,    O
the    O
Ommegang    O
of    O

has    O
taken    O
the    O
form    O
of    O
a    O
historical    O
reenactment    O

the    O
mid-16th    O
century    O
,    O
the    O
Ommegang    O
not    O
only    O
celebrated    O
the    O
miraculous    O
legend    O
,    O
but    O
became    O
intertwined    O
with    O
the    O
Joyous    O
Entry    O
of    O
Holy    O
Roman    O
Emperor    O
Charles    B-Archduke109804658

The    O
Ommegang    O
thus    O
developed    O
into    O
an    O
important    O
religious    O
and    O
civil    O
event    O
in    O
the    O
annual    O
calendar    O
of    O

.    O

When    O
it    O

revealed    O
in    O
1514    O

he    O
was    O
planning    O
to    O
relinquish    O
the    O

a    O
candidate    O
of    O
King    O
Louis    O
XII    O
of    O
France    O
,    O
he    O
lost    O
the    O

who    O
forced    O
him    O
to    O
resign    O
on    O
9    O
May    O
1517    O
.    O

In    O
a    O
politically    O
motivated    O
move    O
,    O
Philip    O
was    O
appointed    O
bishop    O

also    O
