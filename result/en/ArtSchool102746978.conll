By    O
the    O
early    O
1960s    O
minimalism    O
emerged    O
as    O
an    O
abstract    O
movement    O
in    O
art    O
(    O
with    O
roots    O
in    O
the    O
geometric    O
abstraction    O
of    O
Kazimir    O
Malevich    O
,    O
the    O

and    O
Piet    O

)    O
that    O
rejected    O
the    O
idea    O
of    O
relational    O
and    O
subjective    O
painting    O
,    O
the    O
complexity    O
of    O
abstract    O
expressionist    O
surfaces    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
emotional    O
zeitgeist    O
