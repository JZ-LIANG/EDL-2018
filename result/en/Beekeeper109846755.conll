The    O
Western    O

the    O

the    O

derive    O
from    O
ancient    O

He    O
also    O
restricted    O
his    O

was    O
an    O
important    O
influence    O
on    O
later    O
medical    O
writers    O
in    O
Greece    O

eventually    O
Europe    O
.    O

Plato    O
and    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
had    O
already    O
laid    O
the    O
foundations    O
of    O
the    O
doctrine    O
of    O
"    O
pneuma    O
"    O
,    O
for    O
which    O
,    O
Aristotle    O
was    O
the    O
first    O
to    O
describe    O
the    O
ways    O
in    O
which    O
the    O
"    O
pneuma    O
"    O
is    O
introduced    O
into    O
the    O
body    O
and    O
the    O
sanguineous    O
system    O
.    O

Since    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
,    O
melancholia    O
had    O
been    O
associated    O
with    O
men    O
of    O
learning    O
and    O
intellectual    O
brilliance    O
,    O
a    O

all    O

to    O
study    O
the    O
teachings    O
of    O
Thomas    O
Aquinas    O
,    O
who    O
subscribed    O
to    O
an    O
Aristotelian    B-Beekeeper109846755
view    O
of    O
evolution    O
,    O
in    O

The    O
Ancient    O
Greek    O
theorist    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
had    O
argued    O
that    O
tragedy    O
should    O
concern    O
only    O
great    O
individuals    O
with    O
great    O
minds    O
and    O
souls    O
,    O
because    O
their    O
catastrophic    O
downfall    O
would    O
be    O
more    O
emotionally    O
powerful    O
to    O
the    O
audience    O
;    O
only    O
comedy    O
should    O
depict    O
middle    O
-    O
class    O
people    O
.    O

Unlike    O
his    O
grandfather    O
,    O
Isaiah    O
was    O
an    O
opponent    O
of    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
and    O
of    O
the    O
rest    O
of    O
the    O
Greek    O
philosophers    O
who    O
"    O
denied    O
the    O
Torah    O
.    O
"    O

He    O
wrote    O
a    O
Latin    O
commentary    O
on    O
the    O
"    O
Physics    O
"    O
of    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
,    O
the    O
"    O
Commentarii    O
in    O
Aristotelis    O

,    O
which    O
was    O
completed    O
on    O
1    O
October    O
1473    O

is    O
to    O
be    O
believed    O
.    O

Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
supported    O
this    O
idea    O
by    O
stating    O
that    O
it    O
is    O
necessary    O
to    O
think    O
in    O
opposites    O
to    O
anticipate    O
counterarguments    O
and    O
to    O
arrive    O
at    O
the    O
true    O
state    O
of    O
an    O
idea    O
,    O
object    O
,    O
etc    O
.    O

He    O
wrote    O
several    O
Thomist    O
commentaries    O
on    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
,    O
including    O
the    O
"    O

the    O

"    O
,    O
most    O
of    O
which    O
were    O
printed    O
in    O

his    O
lifetime    O

Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
developed    O
a    O
theory    O
of    O
progressive    O
ensoulment    O
.    O

But    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
held    O
that    O
only    O
male    O
semen    O
gave    O
rise    O
to    O
an    O
embryo    O
,    O
while    O
the    O
female    O
only    O
provided    O
a    O
place    O
for    O
the    O
embryo    O
to    O
develop    O
,    O
(    O
a    O
concept    O
he    O
acquired    O
from    O
the    O
preformationist    O
Pythagoras    O
)    O

Antigone    O
and    O
Creon    O
are    O
prototypical    O
,    O
tragic    O
figures    O
in    O
an    O
Aristotelian    B-Beekeeper109846755
sense    O
as    O
they    O
struggle    O
towards    O
their    O
doomed    O
and    O
lonely    O
end    O
without    O
correcting    O
interference    O
by    O
deities    O

,    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755

the    O
earliest    O
-    O
surviving    O
explanation    O
for    O
the    O
origin    O
of    O

in    O
his    O
"    O

"    O
,    O
in    O
which    O
he    O
argues    O
that    O
tragedy    O
developed    O
from    O
the    O
improvisations    O
of    O
the    O
leader    O
of    O

:    O

The    O
most    O
important    O
sources    O
for    O
French    O
tragic    O
theatre    O
in    O
the    O
Renaissance    O
were    O
the    O
example    O
of    O
Seneca    O
and    O
the    O
precepts    O
of    O
Horace    O
and    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
(    O
and    O
contemporary    O
commentaries    O
by    O
Julius    O
Caesar    O
Scaliger    O

Lodovico    O
Castelvetro    O

Although    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
says    O
that    O
catharsis    O
(    O
purgation    O
of    O
emotion    O
)    O
should    O
be    O
the    O
goal    O
of    O
tragedy    O
,    O
this    O
is    O
only    O
an    O
ideal    O
.    O

Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
wrote    O
in    O
his    O
work    O
"    O
Poetics    O
"    O
that    O

According    O
to    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
,    O
"    O
the    O
structure    O
of    O
the    O
best    O
tragedy    O
should    O
not    O
be    O
simple    O
but    O
complex    O
and    O
one    O
that    O
represents    O
incidents    O
arousing    O
fear    O
and    O
pity    O
—    O
for    O
that    O
is    O
peculiar    O
to    O
this    O
form    O

According    O
to    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
,    O
"    O

error    O

frailty    O

"    O

It    O
is    O
also    O
a    O
misconception    O
that    O
this    O
reversal    O
can    O
be    O
brought    O
about    O
by    O
a    O

power    O

about    O
by    O
an    O
external    O
cause    O
,    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
describes    O
this    O
as    O
a    O
misadventure    O

not    O
a    O
tragedy    O

According    O
to    O

Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
recorded    O
in    O
his    O
"    O

The    O
use    O
of    O

Khayyam    O

for    O

Khayyam    O

correctly    O

acute    O
cases    O
based    O
on    O
his    O

Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
introduced    O
what    O
may    O
be    O
called    O
a    O
scientific    O
method    O
.    O

He    O
used    O
similar    O
arguments    O
to    O
show    O
that    O
the    O
ancient    O
emission    O
theory    O
of    O
vision    O
supported    O
by    O
Ptolemy    O
and    O

(    O

both    O

He    O
also    O
explained    O
the    O
role    O
of    O
induction    O
in    O
syllogism    O
,    O
and    O
criticized    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
for    O
his    O
lack    O
of    O
contribution    O
to    O
the    O

of    O
induction    O
,    O
which    O
Ibn    O

Haytham    O
regarded    O
as    O
superior    O
to    O
syllogism    O
,    O
and    O
he    O
considered    O
induction    O
to    O
be    O

basic    O
requirement    O

The    O
writings    O
of    O
a    O
number    O
of    O
medieval    O
scholars    O
were    O
condemned    O
,    O
apparently    O
for    O
pantheism    O
,    O

it    O
was    O

stated    O
that    O
:    O

This    O
misled    O
the    O

Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
to    O
believe    O
that    O

only    O

was    O
based    O
on    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
who    O
around    O
about    O
335    O
BC    O

said    O
that    O

the    O
absence    O
of    O

motive    O
power    O
,    O
all    O
objects    O
(    O

would    O
come    O
to    O
rest    O

that    O

only    O
continue    O
to    O
move    O
so    O
long    O
as    O
there    O
is    O

Some    O
,    O

Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755

that    O
music    O
affects    O
the    O
soul    O

Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755

While    O
incorrect    O
by    O
modern    O
standards    O
,    O
this    O
claim    O
was    O
still    O
far    O
closer    O
to    O
the    O
truth    O
than    O
the    O
ancient    O
Aristotelian    B-Beekeeper109846755
theory    O
,    O
which    O
held    O
that    O
the    O
heavenly    O
bodies    O
consist    O
of    O
a    O
special    O
fifth    O
element    O
which    O
naturally    O
moves    O
in    O

accounts    O
,    O

According    O
to    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
,    O
Adramyttium    O
was    O

The    O
concept    O
,    O
if    O
not    O
the    O
phrase    O
,    O
was    O
familiar    O
to    O

as    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755

who    O
wrote    O

More    O
than    O
Plato    O
attempted    O
to    O
do    O
,    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
flatly    O
opposed    O
letting    O
the    O

power    O
beyond    O
guarding    O
and    O

by    O

atomism    O
of    O

and    O
Lucretius    O
,    O
that    O
nature    O
contains    O
no    O
vacuums    O
because    O
the    O
denser    O
surrounding    O
material    O
continuum    O
would    O
immediately    O

the    O

(    O
circa    O

According    O
to    O
Marx    O
,    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
already    O

,    O
Aristotle    O
's    O
analysis    O

lacked    O
a    O

According    O
to    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
,    O
he    O
expanded    O
the    O
number    O
of    O
characters    O
in    O
theater    O
allowing    O
conflict    O
among    O
them    O

,    O
according    O
to    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755

(    O
c.    O

suggests    O
that    O

stepped    O
out    O

(    O

the    O

anarchy    O
negatively    O
,    O
in    O
association    O
with    O
democracy    O
which    O
they    O
mistrusted    O
as    O

The    O
idea    O
of    O
credibility    O
was    O
first    O
derived    O
from    O

argued    O
that    O
the    O
speaker    O

must    O
be    O
built    O
and    O

down    O
to    O

The    O

of    O

whereas    O
Aristotle    B-Beekeeper109846755
attributes    O
to    O
Plato    O
the    O
idea    O
that    O

are    O

the    O
letter    O
implies    O
that    O
Dion    O
's    O
followers    O
wrote    O
to    O
Plato    O
asking    O
him    O
for    O
practical    O
political    O
advice    O
while    O
at    O
the    O
same    O
time    O
insinuating    O
that    O
he    O
had    O
not    O
been    O
loyal    O
to    O
Dion    O
,    O
that    O
Calippus    O
permitted    O
the    O
letter    O
to    O
get    O
to    O
Plato    O
,    O
and    O
that    O
Plato    O
replied    O
by    O
recounting    O
in    O
detail    O
recent    O
history    O
to    O
people    O
who    O
were    O
immediately    O
involved    O
in    O
those    O
events    O

Similarly    O

In    O
his    O
view    O

it    O

suggest    O

Augustine    O
was    O
not    O
strongly    O
influenced    O
by    O
Christianity    O

its    O
ideologies    O
,    O
but    O
after    O
coming    O
in    O
contact    O
with    O
Ambrose    B-Beekeeper109846755
of    O
Milan    O
,    O
Augustine    O
reevaluated    O
himself    O

forever    O
changed    O
