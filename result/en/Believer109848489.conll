There    O
they    O
found    O
a    O
hermit    O
who    O
informed    O
them    O
that    O
the    O
beasts    O
there    O
annihilated    O
themselves    O
by    O

The    O
narrative    O
in    O
Acts    O
continues    O
,    O
saying    O
that    O
"    O
when    O
the    O
apostles    O
who    O
were    O
at    O
Jerusalem    O
heard    O
that    O

had    O
received    O
the    O
word    O
of    O
God    O
,    O

sent    O
Peter    B-Believer109848489

John    B-Believer109848489
to    O
them    O
,    O
who    O
,    O
when    O
they    O
had    O
come    O
down    O
,    O
prayed    O
for    O
them    O
that    O
they    O
might    O
receive    O
the    O
Holy    O
Spirit    O

the    O
14th    O

,    O
a    O

stood    O

He    O
was    O
appointed    O

of    O
Aughrim    O
by    O
Saint    B-Believer109848489

;    O
the    O
site    O
of    O

very    O
first    O

missionaries    O
in    O

He    O
would    O
appear    O
to    O
have    O
been    O
one    O

second    O

was    O
ordained    O
by    O
Saint    B-Believer109848489
Patrick    I-Believer109848489
;    O
thus    O
he    O
would    O
have    O
been    O
active    O
sometime    O
in    O
the    O
early    O

argues    O
that    O

practical    O
guidelines    O

for    O

fits    O
well    O
with    O
the    O

of    O

proposed    O
by    O

in    O

by    O
the    O

also    O
known    O
as    O
Colm    O

,    O
who    O
had    O
been    O
exiled    O
from    O
his    O
native    O
Ireland    O
as    O
a    O
result    O
of    O

Adomnan    O
of    O
Iona    O
wrote    O
a    O
story    O
about    O
St    B-Believer109848489
Columba    I-Believer109848489
giving    O
a    O
sword    O
decorated    O
with    O
carved    O
ivory    O
as    O
a    O
gift    O
that    O
a    O
penitent    O
would    O
bring    O
to    O
his    O
master    O
so    O
he    O
could    O
redeem    O
himself    O
from    O

The    O
river    O
takes    O
its    O
name    O
"    O
Súileach    O
"    O
from    O
a    O
man    O
-    O

that    O
was    O
chopped    O

,    O
who    O
was    O
born    O
in    O
Gartan    O

It    O
was    O
dedicated    O
to    O
St.    O
Columba    B-Believer109848489

and    O
perhaps    O
was    O
a    O

of    O

Baithéne    O
mac    O
Brénaind    O
(    O
or    O
Saint    O
Baithen    O
)    O
was    O
an    O
Irish    O
monk    O
,    O
specially    O
selected    O
by    O
Saint    O
Columba    B-Believer109848489
as    O
one    O
of    O
the    O

set    O

for    O
what    O

now    O

in    O

.    O

Most    O
of    O
what    O
is    O
known    O
about    O
him    O
comes    O
from    O
Adomnán    O
of    O

founder    O
,    O
St    B-Believer109848489
Columba    I-Believer109848489
,    O
in    O
which    O
he    O
included    O
many    O
stories    O
about    O
Baithéne    O
.    O

Baithéne    O
was    O
the    O
son    O
of    O
Brénainn    O
mac    O
Ferguso    O
,    O
who    O
was    O
the    O
brother    O
of    O
the    O
father    O
of    O
St    B-Believer109848489
Columba    I-Believer109848489
,    O
making    O
Baithéne    O
a    O
first    O
cousin    O
of    O
Columba    O
.    O

Although    O
it    O

not    O
known    O
where    O

when    O

made    O
,    O
the    O
similarities    O
to    O
the    O
manuscripts    O
noted    O
above    O
make    O
it    O
likely    O
that    O
it    O
was    O
made    O
in    O
one    O
of    O

The    O
narrative    O
in    O

continues    O

that    O
"    O
when    O
the    O
apostles    O
who    O
were    O
at    O
Jerusalem    O
heard    O
that    O
Samaria    O
had    O
received    O
the    O
word    O
of    O
God    O
,    O
they    O
sent    O
Peter    B-Believer109848489

John    B-Believer109848489
to    O
them    O
,    O
who    O
,    O
when    O
they    O
had    O
come    O
down    O
,    O
prayed    O
for    O
them    O
that    O

might    O

what    O
changed    O

the    O

calls    O

The    O
original    O
title    O
"    O
This    O
Rock    O
"    O
referred    O
to    O
Matthew    O
16:18    O
,    O
in    O
which    O
Jesus    O
tells    O
the    O
apostle    O
Peter    B-Believer109848489
:    O
"    O
You    O
are    O
Peter    O
,    O
and    O

dates    O
from    O
the    O

The    O
symbolic    O
significance    O
of    O
the    O
sword    O
was    O
connected    O
to    O
the    O

claim    O
to    O
both    O
supreme    O
spiritual    O
and    O
temporal    O
power    O
,    O
derived    O
from    O
the    O
Biblical    O

three    O
hermits    O

the    O

of    O
these    O
miracles    O
attracted    O
increasing    O
numbers    O
of    O
disciples    O
,    O
for    O
whom    O
Landelin    O
had    O
a    O
chapel    O

In    O

wrote    O
widely    O
on    O
a    O
theory    O
of    O

sees    O

the    O

the    O
distinction    O
between    O

St.    O
John    O
Chrysostom    O
in    O
the    O
4th    O

regarded    O

as    O
worse    O
than    O
murder    O
in    O
his    O
fourth    O
homily    O

in    O
the    O
"    O
Epistle    O
to    O
the    O

referred    O
to    O

sex    O
relations    O
as    O
"    O
shameful    O

"    O
and    O
which    O
acts    O
were    O
contrary    O
to    O
nature    O
,    O
with    O
men    O
suffering    O
a    O
"    O
due    O
penalty    O
"    O
in    O
their    O
bodies    O

This    O
idea    O
is    O
recalled    O
in    O
the    O
book    O
of    O
Romans    O
:    O
"    O

how    O

had    O
turned    O

to    O

more    O

of    O
the    O

In    O
any    O
case    O
there    O
was    O
an    O
Archbishopric    O
or    O
bishopric    O
of    O
the    O
Frisians    O
founded    O
for    O
Willibrord    B-Believer109848489

This    O

was    O
a    O

daughter    O

"    O
of    O
Velsen    O

which    O
itself    O
was    O

by    O

The    O
Echternach    O
Gospels    O
were    O
probably    O
taken    O
by    O
St.    B-Believer109848489

,    O
a    O
Northumbrian    O

in    O
Luxembourg    O
,    O
from    O
which    O
they    O
are    O
named    O
.    O

He    O
seems    O
to    O
have    O
been    O
associated    O
with    O
Saint    B-Believer109848489
Willibrord    I-Believer109848489
,    O
and    O
to    O

been    O
appointed    O

Utrecht    O
in    O
about    O
739–741    O
.    O

However    O
,    O
it    O
has    O
been    O
doubted    O
whether    O
Wilfrid    O
was    O
actually    O
successful    O
in    O
Frisia    O
,    O
since    O
there    O
is    O
no    O
other    O
evidence    O
of    O
the    O
success    O
of    O
Christianity    O
there    O
before    O
the    O
work    O
of    O
Willibrord    B-Believer109848489
.    O

Among    O
those    O

who    O
organised    O
the    O
mission    O
to    O
Frisia    O
.    O

He    O
was    O
one    O
of    O
Saint    O
Willibrord    B-Believer109848489
's    O
companions    O
in    O
preaching    O
the    O
gospel    O
in    O
Holland    O
and    O
Frisia    O
.    O

He    O
then    O
went    O
in    O

assist    O
Saint    O

(    O
who    O
had    O
also    O
been    O

in    O
the    O

where    O
he    O
became    O

with    O
Egmond    O
.    O

The    O
