Its    O
industries    O
included    O
iron    O
foundries    O
,    O
rolling    O
mills    O
,    O
puddling    B-Blacksmith109859152

the    O

,    O

brass    O
wares    O

The    O
inexpensive    O
process    O
for    O
making    O
good    O
quality    O
wrought    O
iron    O
was    O
puddling    B-Blacksmith109859152
,    O
which    O
became    O
widespread    O
after    O
1800    O
.    O
Puddling    O
involved    O
stirring    O
molten    O
cast    O
iron    O
until    O
small    O
globs    O
sufficiently    O
decarburized    O
to    O
form    O
globs    O
of    O
hot    O
wrought    O
iron    O
that    O
were    O
then    O
removed    O
and    O
hammered    O
into    O
shapes    O
.    O

The    O
Bessemer    O
and    O
open    O
hearth    O
processes    O
were    O
much    O
more    O
efficient    O
than    O
making    O
steel    O
by    O
the    O
puddling    B-Blacksmith109859152
process    I-Blacksmith109859152
because    O
they    O
used    O
the    O
carbon    O
in    O
the    O
pig    O
iron    O
as    O
a    O
source    O
of    O
heat    O
.    O

Around    O
the    O
1840s    O
,    O
developments    O
in    O
the    O
puddling    B-Blacksmith109859152
furnace    I-Blacksmith109859152
reduced    O
the    O
cost    O
of    O
wrought    O
iron    O
and    O
improvements    O
to    O
rolling    O
mills    O
allowed    O
the    O
production    O
of    O
large    O
flat    O
sections    O
.    O

The    O
process    O
of    O
puddling    B-Blacksmith109859152
was    O
the    O
occupation    O
's    O
chief    O
responsibility    O
and    O
involvement    O
.    O

This    O
transition    O
included    O
going    O
from    O
hand    O
production    O
methods    O
to    O
machines    O
,    O
new    O
chemical    O
manufacturing    O
and    O
iron    B-Blacksmith109859152
production    I-Blacksmith109859152
processes    O
,    O
the    O
increasing    O
use    O
of    O
steam    O
power    O
,    O
the    O
development    O
of    O
machine    O
tools    O
and    O
the    O
rise    O
of    O
the    O
factory    O
system    O
.    O

The    O
puddling    B-Blacksmith109859152
process    I-Blacksmith109859152
produced    O
a    O
structural    O
grade    O
iron    O
at    O
a    O
lower    O
cost    O
than    O
the    O
finery    O
forge    O
.    O

The    O
first    O
is    O
referred    O
to    O
today    O
as    O
potting    O
and    O
stamping    O
,    O
but    O
this    O
was    O
superseded    O
by    O
Henry    O
Cort    O
's    O
puddling    B-Blacksmith109859152
process    O
.    O

Cort    O
developed    O
two    O
significant    O
iron    O
manufacturing    O
processes    O
:    O
rolling    O
in    O
1783    O
and    O
puddling    B-Blacksmith109859152
in    O
1784    O
.    O

Railways    O
were    O

the    O
