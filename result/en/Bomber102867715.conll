These    O

,    O
the    O

was    O
handicapped    O
at    O

Most    O
of    O
these    O

as    O

the    O

technicians    O
whose    O
conscription    O
was    O
extended    O
to    O
24    O
months    O
because    O
of    O
their    O
particular    O
skills    O

if    O
this    O

The    O

has    O
the    O
distinction    O
of    O
being    O
the    O
only    O
British    O
bomber    O
of    O
the    O
period    O
to    O
see    O
service    O
that    O
had    O
been    O
designed    O
from    O
the    O
start    O
with    O
four    O

to    O

possible    O

and    O
thus    O
making    O
it    O
difficult    O
for    O
