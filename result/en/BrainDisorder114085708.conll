It    O
was    O
revealed    O
in    O
2007    O
that    O
Hamilton    O
was    O
in    O
fact    O
suffering    O
from    O
a    O
combination    O
of    O
dyslexia    B-BrainDisorder114085708

to    O
describe    O
a    O
type    O
of    O
developmental    O
coordination    O
disorder    O
related    O
to    O
dyslexia    B-BrainDisorder114085708

dysgraphia    O
(    O

It    O
has    O
been    O
found    O
that    O
continuous    O
rapid    O
naming    O
of    O
a    O
list    O
,    O
compared    O
to    O
naming    O
of    O
single    O
items    O
,    O
is    O
easier    O
for    O
nondyslexic    O
readers    O
than    O
it    O
is    O
for    O
dyslexic    B-BrainDisorder114085708
ones    O
.    O

Despite    O
this    O
,    O
Wimmer    O
,    O
Mayringer    O
and    O
Landerl    O
(    O
2000    O
)    O
suggest    O
that    O
the    O
diagnosis    O
of    O
dyslexia    B-BrainDisorder114085708
in    O
English    O
readers    O
often    O
overlooks    O
naming    O
-    O
speed    O
deficit    O
and    O
that    O
most    O
studies    O
rely    O
on    O
poor    O
word    O
recognition    O
to    O
diagnose    O
reading    O
disability    O
.    O

It    O
has    O
been    O
proposed    O
that    O
dyslexia    B-BrainDisorder114085708
is    O
due    O
to    O
a    O
"    O
double    O
-    O
deficit    O
hypothesis    O
"    O
in    O
which    O
phonological    O
deficits    O
and    O
naming    O
-    O
speed    O
deficits    O
are    O
two    O
separate    O
causes    O
of    O
reading    O
problems    O
,    O
such    O
that    O
when    O
they    O
are    O
combined    O
,    O
they    O
produce    O
a    O
greater    O
dyslexic    O
defect    O
than    O
would    O
be    O
produced    O
by    O
either    O
deficit    O
individually    O
.    O

The    O
concept    O
of    O
a    O
perceptual    O
noise    O
exclusion    O
deficit    O
is    O
an    O
emerging    O
hypothesis    O
