This    O

that    O
happened    O
in    O
the    O
same    O
period    O
,    O
which    O
was    O
massively    O
important    O
due    O
to    O
the    O
sheer    O
size    O
and    O
low    O
population    O
density    O
of    O
the    O

the    O
development    O
of    O
Steamboats    O
and    O
Rail    O
transport    O
,    O
allowing    O
for    O
the    O
phenomenon    O
of    O
urbanization    O
to    O
begin    O
which    O
increased    O
the    O
labor    O
force    O
available    O
around    O
larger    O
cities    O
such    O
as    O
New    O

City    O
and    O
Chicago    O
,    O
ameliorating    O
the    O
classic    O
