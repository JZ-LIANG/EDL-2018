in    O
January    O

Amin    O
formally    O
began    O
the    O
Great    O

War    O
when    O
he    O
appointed    O
Ali    O
ibn    O

as    O
governor    O
of    O
Khurasan    O
,    O
placed    O
him    O
at    O
the    O
head    O
of    O
an    O
unusually    O
large    O
army    O
of    O
40,000    O

drawn    O
from    O

the    O
precedence    O
of    O
Ali    O
over    O
Abu    O
Bakr    O
,    O
and    O
that    O
therefore    O
when    O
after    O
the    O
death    O
of    O
Muhammad    O
,    O
Abu    O

became    O

disregard    O
of    O

,    O
he    O
was    O
a    O

near    O
,    O
he    O
sent    O
for    O

requested    O
him    O
to    O
perform    O
