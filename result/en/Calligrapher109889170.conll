era    O
(    O

when    O

a    O
small    O

in    O
this    O
location    O
.    O

Buddhism    O
began    O
to    O
spread    O
during    O
the    O
Heian    O
era    O
chiefly    O
through    O
two    O
major    O
sects    O

It    O
was    O
founded    O
by    O

in    O
824    O

According    O
to    O
tradition    O
,    O
when    O
Japan    O
suffered    O
a    O
serious    O
epidemic    O
,    O
the    O

,    O
the    O
founder    O
of    O
Shingon    O
Buddhism    O
,    O
suggested    O
that    O
the    O
Emperor    O
Saga    O
personally    O
copy    O
an    O
important    O
Buddhist    O
religious    O
document    O
called    O
the    O
Heart    O
Sutra    O
(    O

"    O

.    O

In    O
turn    O
,    O
the    O
deity    O
was    O
imported    O
into    O
Japan    O
as    O
by    O
the    O
priest    O

who    O
was    O
studying    O
in    O

as    O
a    O

of    O
the    O

founded    O

The    O
two    O
mandalas    O
are    O
believed    O
to    O
have    O
evolved    O
separately    O
in    O
