,    O
launched    O
a    O
fresh    O
attack    O
on    O
the    O
Mughals    O
in    O
Malwa    O
.    O

The    O
Maratha    B-Caste114431738
maintained    O
frinedly    O
relations    O
with    O

,    O
who    O
held    O
a    O

The    O
Holkar    O

It    O
was    O
here    O
a    O
strategy    O
was    O
made    O
that    O
Maratha    B-Caste114431738
armies    O
would    O
attack    O

However    O
the    O
real    O
threat    O
,    O

During    O
this    O
period    O
,    O
the    O

,    O
the    O
