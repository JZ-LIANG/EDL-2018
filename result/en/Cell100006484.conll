The    O
Warburg    O
hypothesis    O
,    O
sometimes    O
known    O
as    O
the    O
Warburg    O
theory    O
of    O
cancer    O
,    O
postulates    O
that    O
the    O
driver    O
of    O
tumorigenesis    O
is    O
an    O
insufficient    O
cellular    O

to    O
Warburg    O
,    O
the    O
driver    O
of    O

should    O
be    O
interpreted    O
as    O
stemming    O

rather    O
than    O
by    O
a    O
comparatively    O
low    O
rate    O
of    O
glycolysis    O
followed    O
by    O

The    O
SCN    O
is    O
known    O
to    O
be    O
involved    O
not    O
only    O
in    O

through    O
innervation    O
from    O

also    O
in    O

It    O
has    O
been    O
suggested    O
that    O
pinealocytes    O
are    O
derived    O
from    O
photoreceptor    B-Cell100006484
cells    I-Cell100006484

A    O
common    O
theory    O
on    O
the    O
evolution    O
of    O
pinealocytes    O
is    O
that    O
they    O
evolved    O
from    O
photoreceptor    B-Cell100006484
cell    I-Cell100006484
.    O

Albino    O
vertebrates    O
exposed    O
to    O
intense    O
light    O
typically    O
lose    O
photoreceptors    B-Cell100006484
due    O
to    O
apoptosis    O

It    O
consists    O
of    O
a    O
dense    O
network    O

between    O
dendrites    O
of    O
horizontal    B-Cell100006484
cell    I-Cell100006484
from    O
the    O
inner    O
nuclear    O
layer    O
,    O
and    O
photoreceptor    B-Cell100006484
cell    I-Cell100006484
inner    O
segments    O
from    O
the    O
outer    O
nuclear    O
layer    O
.    O

They    O
have    O
a    O
higher    O
number    O
of    O
photoreceptors    B-Cell100006484
,    O
and    O
most    O
birds    O
are    O
tetrachromats    O
.    O

However    O
,    O
both    O
AMD    O
and    O
MacTel    O
eventually    O
lead    O
to    O
(    O
photoreceptor    B-Cell100006484
)    O
atrophy    O
and    O
thus    O
loss    O
of    O
central    O

In    O
the    O
1830s    O
,    O
he    O
was    O
the    O
first    O
to    O
identify    O
rod    O
photoreceptor    B-Cell100006484
cell    I-Cell100006484
in    O
the    O
retina    O
using    O
a    O
microscope    O
.    O

The    O
photoreceptors    B-Cell100006484
are    O
not    O
the    O
normal    O
rod    O
-    O
like    O
or    O
cone    O

like    O
shape    O
that    O
one    O
would    O

already    O
known    O
rods    O

cones    O
,    O
and    O
were    O
shown    O
to    O
be    O
the    O
principal    O
conduit    O
for    O
light    O
input    O
to    O

photoentrainment    O
.    O

The    O
information    O
for    O
color    O
and    O
form    O
comes    O
from    O
P    O
-    O
cells    O
that    O
receive    O
their    O
information    O
mainly    O
from    O
cones    B-Cell100006484
,    O
so    O
they    O
are    O
sensitive    O
to    O
differences    O
in    O
form    O
and    O
color    O
