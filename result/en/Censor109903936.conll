According    O
to    O
Cato    B-Censor109903936
the    I-Censor109903936
Elder    I-Censor109903936
,    O
every    O
garden    O
should    O
be    O
close    O
to    O
the    O
house    O

should    O
have    O

When    O
Cato    B-Censor109903936

became    O

he    O
was    O
given    O
the    O

of    O
the    O
whole    O

In    O
195    O

Ideally    O
,    O
fathers    O
would    O
take    O
an    O
interest    O
even    O
in    O
their    O
infant    O
children    O
;    O
Cato    B-Censor109903936
liked    O
to    O
be    O
present    O
when    O
his    O
wife    O
bathed    O
and    O
swaddled    O

The    O
more    O
modern    O
idea    O
of    O
a    O
piece    O
of    O
a    O
winemaking    O
equipment    O
used    O
to    O
extract    O
the    O
juice    O
from    O
the    O
skins    O
probably    O
emerged    O
during    O
the    O
Greco    O
-    O
Roman    O
periods    O
where    O
written    O
accounts    O
by    O
Cato    B-Censor109903936
the    I-Censor109903936

,    O
Marcus    O
Terentius    O
Varro    O
,    O
Pliny    O

Elder    O
and    O

utilized    O

An    O
example    O
of    O
a    O
convincing    O
application    O
is    O
the    O
silence    O
of    O
Cicero    O
on    O
works    O
of    O
oratory    O
by    O
Cato    B-Censor109903936
;    O
the    O
argument    O
gaining    O
its    O
strength    O
from    O
the    O
fact    O
that    O
Cato    O
was    O
such    O
an    O
important    O
figure    O
in    O
Cicero    O
's    O
"    O
Brutus    O
"    O
and    O
he    O
would    O
have    O
likely    O
been    O

,    O
Varro    O
and    O
Virgil    O
—    O
have    O
provided    O
insight    O
into    O
the    O
role    O
played    O
by    O
wine    O
in    O
Roman    O
culture    O
as    O
well    O
as    O
contemporary    O

Marcus    B-Censor109903936
Porcius    I-Censor109903936
Cato    I-Censor109903936
was    O
a    O
Roman    O
statesman    O
raised    O
in    O
an    O
agricultural    O
family    O
on    O
a    O
farm    O
in    O
Reate    O
northeast    O
of    O
Rome    O
.    O

This    O
Cato    O
was    O
probably    O
the    O
son    O
of    O
Gaius    O
Porcius    O
Cato    O
,    O
the    O
homonymous    O
consul    O
of    O
114    O
BC    O
,    O
being    O
then    O
the    O
grandson    O
of    O
Marcus    O
Porcius    O
Cato    O
Licinianus    O
and    O
thereby    O
the    O

grandson    O
of    O
the    O
famous    O
Cato    O

often    O
called    O
Cato    B-Censor109903936
the    I-Censor109903936
Elder    I-Censor109903936
.    O

Cicero    O
,    O
writing    O
three    O
centuries    O
later    O
in    O
his    O
treatise    O
"    O
On    O
Old    O

Cato    B-Censor109903936
the    I-Censor109903936
Elder    I-Censor109903936
,    O
similarly    O
discussed    O
the    O
prospects    O
of    O
death    O
,    O
frequently    O
referring    O
to    O
the    O
works    O
of    O
earlier    O
Greek    O
writers    O
.    O

After    O
occupying    O
the    O
surrounding    O
area    O
in    O
the    O
early    O
2nd    O
century    O
during    O
the    O
Punic    O
Wars    O
,    O
the    O
Romans    O
finally    O
sacked    O

of    O
Marcus    B-Censor109903936
Porcius    I-Censor109903936
Cato    I-Censor109903936
in    O
the    O
late    O
3rd    O
century    O
.    O

Even    O
the    O
notoriously    O
strict    O
Cato    B-Censor109903936
the    I-Censor109903936
Elder    I-Censor109903936
recommended    O
distributing    O
a    O
daily    O
ration    O
of    O
low    O
quality    O
wine    O
of    O
more    O
than    O
0.5    O

the    O
slaves    O
forced    O
to    O
work    O
on    O
farms    O

,    O
Cato    B-Censor109903936
the    I-Censor109903936
Elder    I-Censor109903936
prophesied    O
Rome    O
's    O
demise    O
;    O
he    O
considered    O
everything    O
Greek    O
to    O
be    O
suspect    O
;    O
he    O
even    O
mistrusted    O
Greek    O
doctors    O
and    O
claimed    O
that    O
they    O
only    O
wanted    O
to    O
poison    O
Romans    O
.    O

Cato    B-Censor109903936
greatly    O
esteemed    O
cabbage    O
,    O
believing    O
it    O
to    O
be    O
good    O
for    O
the    O
digestion    O
,    O
and    O
also    O
believed    O
that    O
if    O
a    O
sick    O
person    O
ate    O
a    O
great    O
deal    O
of    O
cabbage    O
and    O
bathed    O
in    O
his    O
urine    O
,    O
he    O
would    O
recover    O
.    O

He    O
was    O
a    O
candidate    O
for    O
the    O
censorship    O
in    O
184    O
BC    O
,    O
but    O
was    O
defeated    O
by    O
an    O
old    O
enemy    O
of    O
his    O
family    O
,    O

deprived    O

at    O

The    O

According    O
to    O
modern    O
historians    O
the    O
foundation    O
of    O
the    O

was    O
an    O

by    O
the    O
emperor    O
Octavian    B-Censor109903936
to    O
create    O
a    O
strong    O
city    O
of    O
his    O

in    O
an    O
area    O
of    O
Betica    O
(    O

that    O
had    O
overwhelmingly    O
supported    O
Pompey    O
during    O
the    O
Civil    O
War    O
.    O

Creation    O
of    O
this    O
mint    O
was    O
part    O
of    O
the    O
propaganda    O
drive    O
by    O
Octavius    B-Censor109903936
to    O
show    O
the    O
divine    O
character    O
of    O
the    O
emperor    O
.    O

Augustus    B-Censor109903936

An    O

to    O
celebrate    O
his    O
victory    O
over    O
the    O

tribes    O
which    O
lived    O
in    O
the    O

attacked    O

trade    O
routes    O

The    O
late    O
Republican    O
legion    O
was    O
thus    O
probably    O
bereft    O

(    O
a    O
tiny    O
cavalry    O
force    O
of    O
120    O

was    O
probably    O
added    O
back    O

in    O

at    O
the    O
height    O
of    O
his    O
career    O
,    O
Verrius    O
Flaccus    O
,    O
whose    O
prestige    O
allowed    O
him    O
to    O
charge    O

,    O
before    O

The    O

gradually    O
came    O
to    O
apply    O
the    O

"    O
Italia    O
"    O
to    O
a    O
larger    O
region    O
,    O
but    O
it    O
was    O
during    O
the    O
reign    O
of    O
Augustus    B-Censor109903936
,    O
at    O
the    O
end    O
of    O
the    O
1st    O
century    O

that    O
the    O

the    O
transition    O
from    O

was    O
complete    O

the    O

that    O
Christ    O
was    O
actually    O
born    O
around    O
4    O

deriving    O
this    O
from    O

of    O

,    O
citing    O
the    O
letters    O
of    O
Augustus    B-Censor109903936
where    O
the    O

wrote    O
that    O

came    O
to    O
notice    O
as    O

Tiberius    B-Censor109903936
,    O
the    O
emperor    O
Augustus    O
bestowed    O
on    O
him    O
a    O
great    O
deal    O
of    O
wealth    O
,    O
which    O
he    O
used    O
to    O
purchase    O
large    O
parcels    O
of    O
land    O
in    O
Picenum    O

The    O
theatre    O
was    O
built    O
between    O
5    O
and    O
1    O
BC    O
,    O
as    O
has    O
been    O
proven    O
by    O
the    O
dedication    O
of    O
the    O
edifice    O
to    O
Gaius    O
and    O
Lucius    O
Caesar    O
,    O
grandsons    O
of    O
Augustus    B-Censor109903936
,    O
who    O
had    O
designated    O
them    O
as    O
his    O
successors    O
.    O

Originally    O
called    O
Aspurgus    O
,    O
he    O
adopted    O
the    O
Roman    O
names    O
"    O
Tiberius    O
Julius    O
"    O
because    O
he    O
received    O
Roman    O
citizenship    O
and    O
enjoyed    O
the    O
patronage    O
of    O
the    O
first    O
two    O
Roman    O
Emperors    O
,    O
Augustus    B-Censor109903936

The    O
city    O
's    O
division    O
into    O

"    O
remained    O
in    O
use    O
until    O
7    O
BC    O
,    O
when    O
Augustus    B-Censor109903936
divided    O
the    O
city    O
,    O
by    O
now    O

He    O
enjoyed    O
many    O
of    O
the    O
historical    O
episodes    O
he    O
encountered    O
in    O
the    O
book    O
,    O
but    O
realized    O
that    O
much    O
of    O
the    O
public    O
knew    O
little    O
about    O
Rome    O
outside    O
of    O

reasons    O

)    O

He    O
is    O
mainly    O
concerned    O
with    O
the    O
political    O
history    O
of    O
the    O
Roman    O
world    O
in    O
the    O
age    O
of    O
Caesar    O
and    O
Augustus    B-Censor109903936
and    O
in    O
the    O
late    O
antiquity    O
and    O
with    O
the    O
history    O
of    O
Hellenistic    O
and    O
Roman    O
historiography    O
.    O

With    O
his    O
death    O
,    O
Rome    O
split    O
between    O
supporters    O
of    O
Mark    O
Antony    O
and    O
Octavian    B-Censor109903936
.    O

Octavian    B-Censor109903936
was    O
quick    O
to    O
declare    O
war    O
on    O
Antony    O
and    O
Cleopatra    O
while    O
public    O
opinion    O
of    O
Antony    O
was    O
low    O

certain    O
death    O
at    O
the    O
hands    O
of    O
Octavian    B-Censor109903936
,    O
Antony    O
attempted    O
suicide    O
by    O
falling    O
on    O
his    O
own    O
sword    O
.    O

Initially    O
these    O
bodies    O
would    O
consist    O
partly    O
of    O
Roman    O
citizens    O
,    O
usually    O
to    O
the    O
number    O
of    O
three    O
hundred    O
;    O
but    O
after    O
Augustus    B-Censor109903936
the    O
number    O
was    O
increased    O
and    O
thousands    O
of    O
Romans    O
who    O
retired    O
from    O
their    O
legions    O
were    O
granted    O
lands    O
in    O
many    O
"    O
colonies    O

in    O
the    O

During    O
the    O
Civil    O
Wars    O
the    O
coasts    O
of    O
Bruttium    O
were    O
repeatedly    O
laid    O
waste    O
by    O
the    O
fleets    O
of    O
Sextus    O
Pompeius    O
,    O
and    O
witnessed    O
several    O
conflicts    O
between    O
the    O
latter    O
and    O
those    O
of    O
Octavian    B-Censor109903936
,    O
who    O
had    O
established    O
the    O
headquarters    O
both    O
of    O
his    O
army    O
and    O
navy    O
at    O

the    O

for    O

purposes    O
until    O
the    O
fall    O
of    O
the    O
Roman    O

,    O
and    O

governed    O
conjointly    O
by    O
a    O
magistrate    O
termed    O

Pliny    O
the    O

gives    O
us    O
the    O
following    O
story    O
about    O
it    O
:    O
The    O
Emperor    O
Augustus    B-Censor109903936
,    O
being    O
invited    O
to    O
dinner    O
by    O
one    O
of    O
his    O
generals    O
,    O
asked    O
him    O
if    O
it    O
were    O
true    O
that    O
the    O
wreckers    O
of    O
Anahit    O
's    O
statue    O
had    O
been    O
punished    O
by    O
the    O
wrathful    O
goddess    O
.    O
"    O

It    O
belonged    O
to    O
the    O
Celtic    O
kingdom    O
of    O
Noricum    O
,    O
but    O
the    O
Emperor    B-Censor109903936
Augustus    I-Censor109903936
(    O
through    O
his    O
general    O
Tiberius    B-Censor109903936
)    O
added    O
the    O
oppidum    O
to    O
Pannonia    O
,    O
which    O
became    O
a    O
formal    O
province    O
during    O
the    O
second    O
half    O
of    O
the    O
reign    O
of    O
Claudius    B-Censor109903936
(    O
41    O
-    O
54    O
BC).Through    O
the    O
centuries    O
,    O
the    O
mountain    O
,    O
especially    O
the    O
southern    O
slope    O
,    O
was    O
bare    O
of    O
forest    O
and    O
used    O
for    O
vineyards    O
and    O
grazing    O
.    O

Although    O
Tacfarinas    O
'    O
personal    O
motivation    O
is    O
unknown    O
,    O
it    O
is    O
likely    O
that    O
the    O
Roman    O
occupation    O
under    O
Augustus    B-Censor109903936
of    O
the    O
traditional    O

of    O
the    O
Musulamii    O
,    O
and    O
denial    O
of    O
access    O
to    O
the    O
latter    O
,    O
was    O
the    O
determining    O
factor    O
.    O

The    O
Numidian    O
king    O
's    O
young    O
son    O
,    O
Juba    O
II    O
was    O
brought    O
up    O
and    O
educated    O
at    O
Rome    O
,    O
where    O
he    O
became    O
a    O
close    O
friend    O
of    O
Caesar    O
's    O
grand    O
-    O
nephew    O
Octavian    B-Censor109903936
,    O
who    O
assumed    O
the    O
title    O
of    O
Augustus    B-Censor109903936
after    O
he    O
became    O
sole    O
ruler    O
of    O
the    O
Roman    O
empire    O
in    O
30    O
BC    O
.    O

All    O
three    O
were    O
engaged    O
in    O
bitter    O
conflict    O
with    O
Rome    O
during    O
the    O
rule    O
of    O
Augustus    B-Censor109903936
(    O

,    O
and    O
Tacfarinas    O
was    O
able    O
to    O
gain    O
the    O
support    O
of    O
substantial    O
elements    O
of    O
all    O
three    O
tribes    O
for    O
his    O
insurgency    O
.    O

With    O
the    O
pacification    O
of    O
Hispania    O
and    O
the    O
death    O
of    O
Julius    O
Caesar    O
,    O
Augustus    B-Censor109903936
embarked    O
on    O
a    O
series    O
of    O
administrative    O
reforms    O
including    O
the    O
Conventus    O
of    O
Bilbilis    O
.    O

It    O
is    O
said    O
that    O
Timagenes    O
had    O
a    O
falling    O
-    O
out    O
with    O
emperor    O
Augustus    B-Censor109903936
,    O
whereupon    O
he    O
destroyed    O
his    O
writings    O
and    O
fled    O
Rome    O
.    O

He    O
also    O
asked    O
Cleopatra    O
to    O
deliver    O
Mark    O
Antony    O
to    O
the    O
Octavianus    B-Censor109903936

have    O
him    O
put    O
to    O
death    O

A    O

in    O

at    O

time    O
as    O
that    O
of    O
emperor    O
Augustus    B-Censor109903936

,    O
a    O
supporter    O
of    O

The    O

against    O
him    O

by    O
the    O

but    O
accepted    O
the    O
position    O
of    O
"    O
perpetual    O
censor    B-Censor109903936
"    O
,    O
and    O
exercised    O
predominant    O
influence    O
in    O
the    O
councils    O
of    O
the    O
republic    O
until    O
his    O
death    O
.    O

The    O
title    O
"    O
censor    O
"    O
in    O
this    O
context    O
was    O
modeled    O
on    O
its    O
meaning    O
in    O
the    O
Roman    O
Republic    O
,    O
"    O
i.e.    O
"    O
,    O
a    O
highly    O
respected    O
senior    O
public    O
official    O
(    O
see    O
Roman    B-Censor109903936
censor    I-Censor109903936
)    O
,    O
rather    O
than    O
its    O
modern    O
meaning    O
having    O
to    O
do    O
with    O
censorship    O
.    O

In    O
127    O
BC    O
he    O
was    O
consul    O
with    O
Lucius    O
Cornelius    O
Cinna    O
and    O
in    O
125    O
BC    O
he    O
was    O
elected    O
censor    B-Censor109903936
.    O

In    O
ancient    O
Rome    O
,    O
it    O
was    O
also    O
a    O
term    O
for    O
the    O
magistrate    O
called    O
a    O
censor    B-Censor109903936
(    O
in    O
the    O
original    O
sense    O
,    O
rather    O
than    O
the    O
later    O
politicized    O
evolution    O
)    O
,    O
who    O
castigated    O
in    O
the    O
name    O
of    O
the    O
pagan    O
state    O
religion    O
but    O
with    O
the    O
authority    O
of    O
the    O
'    O
pious    O
'    O
state    O
.    O

He    O
could    O
perhaps    O
be    O
the    O
son    O
of    O
Gaius    O
Julius    O
Iulus    O
,    O
who    O
was    O
consular    O
tribune    O
in    O
408    O
and    O
405    O
BC    O
,    O
and    O
who    O
died    O
during    O
his    O
censorship    B-Censor109903936
about    O
393    O
,    O
or    O
of    O
Sextus    O
Julius    O
Iulus    O
,    O
consular    O
tribune    O
in    O
424    O
;    O
he    O
seems    O
less    O
likely    O
to    O
have    O
been    O
the    O
son    O
of    O
Lucius    O
Julius    O
Iulus    O
,    O
who    O
was    O
consular    O
tribune    O
in    O
403    O
,    O
or    O
of    O
the    O
Lucius    O
who    O
was    O
consular    O
tribune    O
in    O
401    O
and    O
397    O
,    O
unless    O
father    O
and    O
son    O
were    O
relatively    O
close    O
in    O
age    O
.    O

As    O
Gaius    O
'    O
filiation    O
has    O
not    O
been    O
preserved    O
,    O
it    O
is    O
uncertain    O
whether    O
he    O
was    O
the    O
son    O
of    O
this    O
Lucius    O
,    O
or    O
perhaps    O
one    O
of    O
his    O
predecessors    O
,    O
such    O
as    O
the    O
Lucius    O
who    O
was    O
consular    O
tribune    O
in    O
401    O
and    O
397    O
,    O
or    O
the    O
Lucius    O
who    O
was    O
consular    O
tribune    O
in    O
403    O
,    O
or    O
the    O
Gaius    O
Julius    O
Iulus    O
who    O
was    O
consular    O
tribune    O
in    O
408    O
and    O
405    O
,    O
and    O
censor    B-Censor109903936
in    O
BC    O
393    O
.    O

He    O
assumed    O
the    O
"    O
toga    O
virilis    O
"    O
(    O
"    O
toga    O
of    O
manhood    O
"    O
)    O
,    O
was    O
enrolled    O
as    O
a    O
citizen    O
on    O
the    O
census    B-Censor109903936
,    O
and    O
soon    O
began    O
his    O
military    O
service    O
.    O

Instead    O
,    O
the    O
Asian    O
tithe    O
contracts    O
were    O
leased    O
out    O
by    O
the    O
censors    B-Censor109903936
in    O
Rome    O
to    O
companies    O
of    O
Roman    O
tax    O
-    O
collectors    O
.    O

They    O
also    O
conducted    O
a    O
census    B-Censor109903936
.    O

His    O
probable    O
father    O
was    O
Quintus    B-Censor109903936
Aemilius    I-Censor109903936
Papus    I-Censor109903936
,    O
who    O
had    O
been    O
consul    O
twice    O
and    O
censor    B-Censor109903936
once    O
;    O
if    O
true    O
,    O
he    O
would    O
have    O
been    O
born    O
to    O
a    O
father    O
already    O
in    O
his    O
late    O
fifties    O
to    O
sixties    O
at    O
the    O
very    O
least    O
.    O

Papus    O
was    O
elected    O
censor    B-Censor109903936
in    O
275    O
BC    O
,    O
again    O
with    O
Luscinus    O
as    O
his    O
colleague    O
.    O

In    O
108    O
,    O
he    O
was    O
censor    B-Censor109903936
with    O
his    O
co    O
-    O
consul    O
,    O
though    O
as    O
with    O
some    O
of    O
his    O
other    O
offices    O
,    O
Allobrogicus    O
has    O
also    O
been    O
proposed    O
as    O
the    O
Quintus    O
Fabius    O
Maximus    O
who    O
served    O
.    O

Then    O
in    O
108    O
BC    O
,    O
either    O
he    O
or    O
Quintus    O
Fabius    O
Maximus    O
Eburnus    O
was    O
appointed    O
to    O
the    O
office    O
of    O

Appius    B-Censor109903936

Pulcher    I-Censor109903936
removed    O
him    O
from    O
the    O
Senate    O
on    O
the    O
grounds    O
of    O
gross    O
immorality    O
(    O
probably    O
really    O
because    O
of    O
his    O
opposition    O
to    O
Milo    O
and    O
Cicero    O
)    O
.    O

Bulbus    O

served    O
as    O

The    O
emperor    O
's    O
legal    O
authority    O
derived    O
from    O
an    O
extraordinary    O
concentration    O
of    O
individual    O
powers    O
and    O
offices    O
that    O
were    O
extant    O
in    O
the    O
Republic    O
rather    O
than    O
from    O
a    O
new    O
political    O
office    O
;    O
emperors    O

offices    O
of    O

Censor    B-Censor109903936
:    O
a    O

office    O
held    O
jointly    O
by    O
two    O
former    O
consuls    O
every    O
five    O
years    O
for    O
the    O
purpose    O
of    O
conducting    O
the    O
"    O
lustrum    O
"    O
that    O
determined    O
the    O
role    O
of    O
citizens    O
;    O
the    O

could    O
audit    O
all    O

all    O

Titus    O

tribunician    O
power    O
with    O

seven    O
consulships    O

In    O
253    O

had    O
the    O

In    O
169    O

an    O

for    O

The    O
Servian    O
constitution    O
introduced    O
two    O
elements    O
into    O
the    O
Roman    O
system    O
of    O
government    O
:    O
a    O
census    B-Censor109903936
of    O
every    O
male    O
citizen    O
,    O
to    O
establish    O
his    O
wealth    O
,    O
tax    O
liabilities    O
,    O
military    O
obligation    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
weight    O
of    O
his    O
vote    O
;    O
and    O
the    O
"    O
comitia    O

height    O
during    O

is    O
presumed    O
to    O
be    O
the    O
"    O
siser    O
"    O
mentioned    O
by    O
Pliny    O
the    O

as    O
a    O
favourite    O
of    O
the    O
Emperor    O
Tiberius    B-Censor109903936
,    O
though    O
this    O
may    O
have    O
also    O
been    O
a    O
reference    O
to    O
a    O
parsnip    O
or    O
carrot    O
.    O

This    O
was    O
probably    O
stimulated    O
by    O
the    O
publication    O
in    O
1614    O
of    O
a    O
Dutch    O
translation    O
of    O
the    O
collection    O
of    O

of    O

in    O
the    O
reign    O
of    O

Aspurgus    O
adopted    O
the    O
Roman    O
names    O
"    O
Tiberius    O
Julius    O
"    O
,    O
because    O
he    O
received    O
Roman    O
citizenship    O

enjoyed    O
the    O

the    O
story    O
appears    O
to    O
have    O
an    O
ecological    O
meaning    O

it    O

The    O
emperors    O
Tiberius    B-Censor109903936

Caligula    O
solved    O
this    O
problem    O
by    O
paying    O
protection    O
money    O
to    O
the    O

superior    O
to    O
the    O
children    O
of    O

In    O
considering    O
the    O
poem    O

date    O
,    O
scholars    O
have    O
proposed    O
three    O
hypotheses    O
:    O
that    O
it    O
was    O
written    O
entirely    O
under    O
Augustus    B-Censor109903936
(    O
who    O
ruled    O
from    O
27    O
BC    O
until    O
AD    O
14    O
)    O
,    O
or    O
under    O
the    O
reigns    O
of    O
both    O
Augustus    O
and    O
Tiberius    B-Censor109903936
(    O
who    O
ruled    O
from    O
AD    O
1437    O
)    O
,    O
or    O
entirely    O
under    O
Tiberius    O
.    O

Although    O
Augustus    O
could    O
claim    O
that    O
his    O
power    O
was    O
authentically    O
republican    O
,    O
his    O
successor    O
,    O
Tiberius    B-Censor109903936
,    O
could    O
not    O
convincingly    O
make    O
the    O
same    O
claim    O
.    O

Instead    O
,    O
Augustus    O
actively    O
prepared    O
his    O
adopted    O
son    O
Tiberius    B-Censor109903936
to    O
be    O
his    O

An    O

that    O

the    O

of    O

is    O
Plutarch    O
's    O
story    O
of    O
the    O
death    O
of    O
Crassus    B-Censor109903936
,    O
in    O
which    O
his    O
head    O
was    O
taken    O
to    O
the    O
Parthian    O
court    O
and    O
used    O
as    O
a    O
prop    O
in    O
a    O
performance    O
of    O

The    O
man    O
selected    O
for    O
the    O
task    O
was    O
Marcus    O

,    O
grandson    O
of    O
Crassus    B-Censor109903936

The    O

the    O
Parthians    O
in    O
53    O
B.C.    O
,    O
but    O
Roman    O
historians    O
allege    O
that    O
he    O
betrayed    O
Crassus    O
by    O
leading    O
him    O
to    O
deviate    O
from    O
his    O
safe    O
route    O
along    O
the    O
river    O
and    O
instead    O
into    O
an    O
open    O
desert    O
,    O
where    O
the    O
troops    O
suffered    O
from    O
the    O
barrenness    O
and    O
were    O
thus    O
vulnerable    O
to    O
cavalry    O
attack    O
.    O

The    O
so    O
-    O
called    O

In    O
61    O
