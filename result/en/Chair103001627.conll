a    O

a    O

"    O
The    O
form    O
is    O
thought    O
to    O
be    O
extrapolated    O
from    O
Roman    O
folding    O
chairs    O
known    O
as    O
the    O

Curule    B-Chair103001627

was    O
a    O

that    O
developed    O
hieratic    O
significance    O
in    O
Republican    O
Rome    O
.    O

The    O

goes    O
back    O

of    O
the    O

The    O

originally    O

Postmodern    O
architecture    O
emerged    O
in    O

as    O
a    O
reaction    O
against    O

For    O
example    O
,    O
in    O

But    O
while    O
these    O
early    O
Functionalist    O
works    O

hallmarks    O

in    O
all    O
these    O
buildings    O
Aalto    O
nevertheless    O
started    O
to    O
show    O
his    O
individuality    O
in    O
a    O
departure    O
from    O
such    O
norms    O
with    O
the    O
introduction    O
of    O

It    O
was    O
during    O

It    O
could    O
be    O
said    O
that    O

while    O
his    O
work    O
with    O
