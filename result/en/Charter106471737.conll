Although    O

chief    O
among    O
them    O
James    O
Madison    O
and    O
Alexander    O
Hamilton    O
,    O
was    O
to    O
create    O
a    O
new    O
government    O
rather    O
than    O
fix    O
the    O

the    O

Most    O
importantly    O
,    O
they    O
agreed    O
that    O
the    O
Convention    O
should    O
go    O
beyond    O
its    O
mandate    O
merely    O
to    O
amend    O

instead    O
should    O
produce    O

this    O
evidence    O
it    O
is    O
thought    O
that    O

At    O

apparent    O
to    O

were    O
not    O
tested    O
in    O

until    O
the    O
1970s    O

1980s    O
,    O
when    O
the    O

thus    O

the    O

interpreted    O
to    O
apply    O
only    O
to    O
the    O

The    O
Second    O

has    O
held    O
that    O

This    O
is    O
the    O
last    O
of    O
four    O
papers    O
by    O
Madison    O
examining    O
the    O
authority    O
of    O
the    O
constitutional    O
convention    O
that    O
had    O
produced    O

In    O
Federalist    O
45    O
,    O
Madison    O
argues    O
that    O
the    O
Union    O
as    O
outlined    O
in    O
the    O
Constitution    B-Charter106471737
is    O
necessary    O
to    O
the    O
people    O
’s    O
happiness    O
and    O
that    O
the    O
balance    O
of    O
power    O
between    O
the    O
states    O
and    O
the    O
national    O
government    O
will    O
support    O
the    O
greatest    O
happiness    O
for    O
the    O
people    O
.    O

This    O
paper    O
examines    O
the    O
separation    O
of    O
powers    O
among    O
the    O
executive    O
,    O
legislative    O
,    O
and    O

proposed    O
United    B-Charter106471737
States    I-Charter106471737

due    O
to    O
the    O
confusion    O
of    O
the    O
concept    O
at    O
the    O
citizen    O
level    O
.    O

This    O
essay    O
examines    O
the    O
relative    O
strength    O
of    O
the    O
state    O
and    O
federal    O
governments    O

Madison    O
then    O
reminds    O
his    O
audience    O
that    O
it    O
is    O
a    O
moment    O
of    O
public    O
passion    O
that    O
has    O
caused    O
the    O
drafters    O
to    O
write    O
the    O
proposed    O
United    B-Charter106471737

Constitution    I-Charter106471737
,    O
and    O
that    O
it    O
would    O
be    O
impractical    O
to    O
provide    O
the    O
opportunity    O
for    O
constant    O
change    O
once    O
it    O

an    O
