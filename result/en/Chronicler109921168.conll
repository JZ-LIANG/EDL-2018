,    O
and    O
some    O
decades    O
later    O
the    O
book    O
was    O
recorded    O
by    O
Archbishop    B-Chronicler109921168
Ussher    I-Chronicler109921168
in    O
the    O

It    O
was    O
borrowed    O
and    O
studied    O
by    O
James    B-Chronicler109921168
Ussher    I-Chronicler109921168
,    O
probably    O
when    O
he    O
was    O
Bishop    O
of    O
Meath    O
from    O
1621–1623    O
.    O

He    O
was    O
born    O
on    O
26    O
November    O
1624    O
at    O
Ardbraccan    O
,    O

episcopal    O
palace    O
of    O
his    O

,    O
James    B-Chronicler109921168

,    O
at    O
that    O

Meath    O
.    O

Although    O
James    B-Chronicler109921168
Ussher    I-Chronicler109921168
regarded    O
it    O
as    O
genuine    O
,    O
if    O
there    O
is    O
any    O
genuine    O
nucleus    O
of    O
the    O
"    O
Martyrium    O
"    O
,    O
it    O
has    O
been    O
so    O
greatly    O
expanded    O
with    O
interpolations    O
that    O
no    O

of    O
it    O
is    O

John    O
Smyth    O
.    O

Among    O
the    O
various    O
cases    O
which    O
he    O
treated    O
the    O
most    O
important    O
one    O
,    O
or    O
at    O
least    O
the    O
one    O
in    O
which    O
he    O
took    O
most    O
pride    O
,    O
was    O
that    O
of    O
Archbishop    B-Chronicler109921168
Usher    I-Chronicler109921168
,    O
‘    O

baffled    O

In    O
1617    O
Thomas    O

appointed    O
judge    O
of    O
the    O
Irish    O
Court    O
of    O
Faculties    O
,    O
but    O
he    O
became    O
embroiled    O
in    O
a    O
long    O
dispute    O
with    O
James    B-Chronicler109921168
Ussher    I-Chronicler109921168
,    O
Archbishop    O
of    O
Armagh    O
,    O
and    O
other    O
leading    O
clerics    O
,    O
who    O
argued    O
that    O
only    O
a    O
clergyman    O
in    O
holy    O
orders    O
should    O
hold    O
the    O
office    O
.    O

He    O
enjoyed    O
the    O
trust    O
and    O
confidence    O
of    O
King    O
Charles    O
I    O
,    O
and    O
displayed    O
courage    O
and    O
loyalty    O
to    O
the    O
Crown    O
in    O
his    O
later    O
years    O
;    O
although    O
Archbishop    O
Ussher    B-Chronicler109921168
disliked    O
and    O
distrusted    O
him    O
.    O

John    O
Keble    O
suggests    O
that    O
Jackson    O
,    O
aggrieved    O
by    O
Spenser    O
's    O
treatment    O
,    O
retained    O
his    O
own    O
recension    O
of    O
Hooker    O

work    O
when    O
he    O
delivered    O
up    O
the    O
other    O
papers    O

and    O
that    O
when    O
his    O

at    O

Hampton    O
was    O
plundered    O

was    O
also    O

,    O
Archbishop    O
of    O

:    O
but    O
his    O
hope    O
of    O
further    O
career    O
advancement    O
was    O
destroyed    O
by    O
the    O
arrival    O

despised    O

Anglii    O
,    O
before    O
coming    O
to    O
Great    O
Britain    O
,    O
dwelt    O
in    O
a    O
land    O
called    O
Angulus    O
,    O
"    O
which    O
lies    O
between    O
the    O
province    O
of    O
the    O
Jutes    O

the    O

Bede    B-Chronicler109921168

Even    O
as    O
late    O
as    O
Bede    B-Chronicler109921168
,    O
we    O
may    O
suspect    O
that    O

may    O
be    O
a    O

The    O

that    O
Bishop    O
John    O
performed    O
,    O
according    O
to    O
Bede    B-Chronicler109921168
,    O
on    O

of    O
Herebald    O
,    O
is    O
another    O
example    O
,    O
since    O
it    O
involved    O
a    O
sufflation    O
that    O
was    O
seemingly    O
exorcistic    O
,    O
catechetical    O
,    O
and    O
curative    O
simultaneously    O
.    O

According    O
to    O
Bede    B-Chronicler109921168
,    O
he    O
was    O
a    O
Berber    O
native    O
of    O
North    O
Africa    O
,    O
and    O
abbot    O
of    O

monastery    O
near    O
Naples    O
,    O
called    O
Monasterium    O
Niridanum    O
(    O
perhaps    O
a    O

to    O
