for    O
the    O

,    O
but    O
in    O
2015    O
had    O
to    O
correct    O
his    O
account    O
of    O
the    O
event    O
,    O
acknowledging    O
that    O
the    O
NBC    O

"    O
was    O
almost    O
certainly    O
taken    O
by    O

upon    O
their    O
release    O
,    O
Richard    O

group    O
of    O

-    O
loyalists    O
for    O
the    O
abduction    O
.    O

He    O
said    O
he    O
therefore    O
had    O
"    O
a    O
very    O
good    O
idea    O
"    O
about    O

of    O
the    O

,    O
stating    O
that    O
it    O
was    O
highly    O
likely    O
that    O
Engel    O
and    O
his    O
team    O
were    O
abducted    O
by    O
a    O

The    O
cause    O
and    O
purpose    O
of    O
French    O
intervention    O
was    O
not    O
entirely    O
clear    O
;    O
French    O
military    O
leaders    O
quickly    O
became    O

by    O
internal    O
quarrels    O
within    O
the    O
anti    O

Bolshevik    O

that    O
prevented    O
effective    O
collaboration    O
against    O
Bolshevik    O
pressures    O
,    O
and    O
they    O
particularly    O
criticized    O
the    O

the    O

which    O
threatened    O
the    O
very    O
existence    O
of    O

–    O
and    O
so    O
required    O
more    O
urgent    O
attention    O
.    O

The    O
