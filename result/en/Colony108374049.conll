This    O
would    O
seem    O
to    O
indicate    O
that    O
the    O

probably    O
of    O
Umbrian    O
or    O
Sabine    B-Colony108374049
origin    O
.    O

is    O
widely    O
believed    O
to    O
have    O
been    O
of    O
Sabine    B-Colony108374049
or    O
Oscan    O
origin    O
,    O
although    O
despite    O
its    O
scarcity    O
it    O
was    O
widely    O
diffused    O
among    O
the    O
Roman    O
plebeians    O
,    O
and    O
even    O
received    O
limited    O
use    O
by    O
a    O
few    O
patrician    O
families    O

When    O
the    O
Sabines    B-Colony108374049

to    O
take    O
advantage    O
of    O
the    O
consuls    O
'    O
absence    O
,    O
Numicius    O
and    O
his    O
colleague    O
invaded    O
their    O
territory    O
simultaneously    O
,    O
ending    O
the    O
threat    O
.    O

Feronia    O
appears    O
to    O
have    O
been    O
a    O
Sabine    B-Colony108374049
goddess    O
,    O
and    O
hence    O
the    O
festivals    O
at    O
her    O
shrine    O
seem    O
to    O
have    O
been    O
attended    O
especially    O
by    O
the    O
Sabines    O
,    O
though    O
the    O
sanctuary    O
itself    O
was    O
in    O
the    O
Etruscan    O
territory    O
,    O
and    O
dependent    O
upon    O
the    O
neighbouring    O
city    O

The    O
first    O
mention    O
of    O
these    O
annual    O
festivals    O
occurs    O
as    O
early    O
as    O
the    O
reign    O
of    O
Tullus    O
Hostilius    O
,    O
when    O
we    O
find    O
them    O
already    O
frequented    O
by    O
great    O
numbers    O
of    O
people    O
,    O
not    O
only    O
for    O
religious    O
objects    O
,    O
but    O
as    O
a    O
kind    O
of    O
fair    O
for    O
the    O
purposes    O
of    O
trade    O
,    O
a    O
custom    O
which    O
seems    O
to    O
have    O
prevailed    O
at    O
all    O
similar    O
meetings    O

the    O

interpreted    O
as    O
defensive    O
fortifications    O
constructed    O
to    O
protect    O
from    O
invasion    O
;    O
however    O
this    O
interpretation    O
most    O
likely    O
resulted    O
from    O

This    O
functional    O
interpretation    O
was    O
also    O
supported    O
by    O

oral    O
tradition    O
from    O
the    O
