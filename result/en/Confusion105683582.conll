known    O
as    O
the    O
Re    O
-    O
commissioning    O
of    O

)    O
is    O
an    O
incident    O
described    O
in    O
John    O
21    O
of    O
the    O
New    O
Testament    O
in    O
which    O
Jesus    O
appeared    O
to    O
his    O
disciples    O
after    O
his    B-Confusion105683582

to    O

"    O
motifs    O
for    O
the    O
burial    O
of    O
a    O
Christian    O
emperor    O
could    O
lie    O
in    O
a    O
Christian    O
interpretation    O
of    O
the    O
Persephone    O
story    O
:    O
the    O
fact    O
that    O
later    O
in    O
the    O
myth    O
Ceres    O
succeeds    O
in    O
bringing    O
Persephone    O
up    O
by    O
her    O
request    O
that    O
her    O
daughter    O
be    O
allowed    O
to    O
return    O
to    O
the    O
Earth    O
for    O
two    O
thirds    O
of    O
the    O
year    O
was    O
perhaps    O
interpreted    O
as    O
a    O
metaphor    O
for    O
the    O

In    O
Christianity    O
,    O
the    O

significant    O

focus    O
on    O

Prior    O
to    O
the    O
Middle    O
Ages    O
,    O
early    O
Christians    O
preferred    O
to    O
focus    O
on    O
the    O
"    O
triumphant    O
"    O
Christ    O
,    O
rather    O
than    O
a    O
dying    O
one    O
,    O
because    O
the    O
concept    O
of    O
the    O
risen    B-Confusion105683582
Christ    I-Confusion105683582
was    O
so    O
central    O
to    O
their    O
faith    O
.    O

perspective    O
on    O
the    O

dilemma    I-Confusion105683582

be    O
resolved    O
in    O
the    O
mind    O
of    O
a    O
divine    O
command    O
theorist    O
by    O
simply    O
accepting    O
that    O
if    O
God    O
tells    O
us    O
to    O
do    O
something    O
which    O
appears    O
to    O
be    O
immoral    O
,    O
then    O
we    O
are    O
to    O
accept    O
that    O
it    O
really    O
is    O
moral    O
in    O
the    O
bigger    O
picture    O
