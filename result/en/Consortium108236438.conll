for    O
copper    O
as    O
OPEC    B-Consortium108236438
does    O
for    O

In    O
June    O
2008    O
,    O
OPEC    B-Consortium108236438
's    O
Secretary    O
General    O
Abdallah    O
Salem    O
el    O
-    O
Badri    O
stated    O
that    O
current    O
world    O
consumption    O
of    O
oil    O
at    O
87    O
million    O
bpd    O
was    O
far    O
exceeded    O
by    O
the    O
"    O
paper    O
market    O
"    O
for    O
oil    O
,    O
which    O
equaled    O
about    O
1.36    O
billion    O
bpd    O
,    O
or    O
more    O
than    O
15    O
times    O
the    O
actual    O
market    O
demand    O
.    O

Because    O
the    O
sharpest    O
production    O
declines    O
had    O
been    O
seen    O
in    O
developed    O
countries    O
,    O
the    O
IEA    O
warned    O
that    O
the    O
greatest    O
growth    O
in    O
production    O
was    O
expected    O
to    O
come    O
from    O
smaller    O
projects    O
in    O
OPEC    B-Consortium108236438
states    O
,    O

their    O
world    O
production    O
share    O
from    O
44%    O
in    O
2008    O
to    O
a    O
projected    O
51%    O
in    O
2030    O
.    O

OPEC    B-Consortium108236438
production    O
was    O
poised    O
to    O
rise    O
further    O
with    O
the    O
lifting    O
of    O
Iranian    O
sanctions    O
,    O
at    O
a    O
time    O
when    O
markets    O
already    O
appeared    O
to    O
be    O
oversupplied    O
by    O
at    O
least    O
2    O
million    O
barrels    O
per    O
day    O
.    O

Because    O
of    O
budget    O
deficits    O
in    O
several    O
countries    O
,    O
they    O
decided    O
to    O
pressure    O
OPEC    B-Consortium108236438
to    O
lower    O
prices    O
instead    O
of    O
lowering    O
taxes    O
.    O

Officials    O
say    O
production    O
is    O
around    O
although    O
most    O
secondary    O
sources    O
such    O
as    O
OPEC    B-Consortium108236438

Nationalization    O
of    O
the    O

was    O
also    O
precipitated    O
by    O

desire    O
to    O
join    O
OPEC    B-Consortium108236438

the    O

was    O
negligible    O
,    O
because    O
the    O
residual    O

that    O

was    O
elastic    O

To    O
be    O
exact    O
,    O
experts    O
told    O
InSight    O
Crime    O
that    O
the    O
peace    O
exists    O
because    O
Joaquín    O
Guzmán    O
Loera    O
wants    O
it    O
that    O
way    O
,    O
and    O
argued    O
that    O
his    O
organization    O
—    O
the    O
Sinaloa    O
Cartel    O
—    O
has    O
spread    O

thin    O
with    O

with    O

and    O
the    O
Juárez    B-Consortium108236438

that    O
opening    O
a    O
third    O
war    O
would    O
be    O
inconvenient    O
.    O

Mexican    O
officials    O
stated    O
that    O
49    O
people    O
were    O
decapitated    O
and    O
mutilated    O
by    O
members    O

of    O
Monterrey    O
in    O
northern    O
Mexico    O

Many    O

them    O
took    O

in    O

,    O
where    O
Los    B-Consortium108236438

have    O
waged    O
a    O

against    O

In    O

the    O
state    O
of    O
Nuevo    O
León    O
and    O
its    O
surrounding    O
territories    O
have    O
become    O
a    O
battleground    O
for    O
a    O
brutal    O
conflict    O
between    O
Los    B-Consortium108236438

that    O

at    O

a    O
message    O
with    O

for    O

but    O
it    O
was    O
later    O
proven    O
that    O
only    O
six    O
of    O
them    O

To    O
be    O

told    O

that    O

it    O
that    O

that    O
