The    O

reaching    O
Lord    B-Constable109959142

seems    O
to    O

glossed    O
over    O
the    O
epic    O
quality    O
of    O
the    O

emphasised    O

The    O
first    O
modern    O
use    O
of    O
a    O
General    O
Staff    O
was    O
in    O
the    O
French    O
Revolutionary    O
Wars    O
,    O
when    O
General    O
Louis    B-Constable109959142
Alexandre    I-Constable109959142
Berthier    I-Constable109959142
(    O
later    O
the    O
first    O
Marshal    O
of    O
the    O
Empire    O
)    O
was    O
assigned    O
as    O
Chief    O
of    O
Staff    O
to    O
the    O
French    O
Army    O
of    O

The    O
role    O
of    O
Chief    O
of    O
Staff    O
in    O
the    O
Grande    O
Armée    O
became    O
almost    O
synonymous    O
with    O
Marshal    O
Louis    B-Constable109959142
Alexandre    I-Constable109959142
Berthier    I-Constable109959142
,    O
who    O
occupied    O
this    O
position    O
in    O
almost    O
all    O
the    O
major    O
campaigns    O
of    O
Napoleon    O
.    O

It    O
was    O
known    O
only    O
to    O
Bonaparte    O
himself    O
,    O
his    O
generals    O
Berthier    B-Constable109959142
and    O
Caffarelli    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
mathematician    O
Gaspard    O
Monge    O
.    O

He    O
left    O
Cairo    O
in    O
August    O
1799    O
on    O
the    O
pretext    O
of    O
a    O
voyage    O
in    O
the    O
Nile    O
Delta    O
without    O
arousing    O
suspicion    O
,    O
accompanied    O
by    O
the    O
scholars    O
Monge    O
and    O
Berthollet    O
,    O
the    O
painter    O
Denon    O

,    O
Murat    O
,    O
Lannes    O
and    O
Marmont    O
.    O

Because    O
of    O
his    O
stubborn    O
personality    O
and    O
limited    O
social    O
skills    O
,    O
he    O
developed    O
many    O
enemies    O
and    O
antagonists    O
within    O
the    O
army    O
's    O
officer    O

Jean    O
-    O
Baptiste    O
Bernadotte    O
,    O
Joachim    O
Murat    O
(    O
with    O
whom    O
he    O
clashed    O
strongly    O
during    O
the    O
1812    O
campaign    O
)    O
,    O
Louis-Alexandre    B-Constable109959142

Baron    O
Thiébault    O
(    O
who    O
would    O
harshly    O
criticize    O
Davout    O
in    O
his    O
memoirs    O
)    O
.    O

When    O
he    O
reached    O
Italy    O
,    O
the    O
treaty    O
of    O
Campo    O
Formio    O
had    O
been    O
signed    O
,    O
and    O
Bonaparte    O
had    O
returned    O
to    O
France    O
;    O
but    O
,    O
under    O
the    O
direction    O
of    O
Berthier    B-Constable109959142
,    O
MacDonald    O
occupied    O
Rome    O
,    O
of    O
which    O
he    O
was    O
made    O
governor    O
,    O
and    O
then    O
in    O
conjunction    O
with    O
Championnet    O
he    O
defeated    O
General    O
Mack    O
,    O
and    O
took    O
the    O
Kingdom    O
of    O
Naples    O
