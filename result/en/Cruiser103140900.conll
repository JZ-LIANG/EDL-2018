By    O
1912    O
the    O
rapid    O
development    O
of    O
dreadnought    O
battleships    O
and    O
battlecruiser    B-Cruiser103140900
left    O
the    O
armored    O
cruisers    O
unable    O
to    O
successfully    O
engage    O
the    O
newer    O
capital    O
ships    O
.    O

The    O
"    O
large    O
light    O
cruisers    O
"    O
were    O
a    O
pet    O
project    O
of    O
Admiral    O
Fisher    O
to    O
operate    O
in    O
shallow    O
Baltic    O
Sea    O
waters    O
and    O
they    O
are    O
often    O
classed    O
as    O
a    O
form    O
of    O
battlecruiser    B-Cruiser103140900
.    O

She    O
was    O
bought    O
in    O
1914    O
and    O
used    O
as    O
a    O
dummy    O
vessel    O
to    O
imitate    O
the    O
battlecruiser    B-Cruiser103140900
.    O

Every    O
battleship    O
and    O
battlecruiser    B-Cruiser103140900
ever    O
built    O
for    O
any    O
country    O
was    O
available    O
for    O
use    O
in    O
gameplay    O
.    O

The    O
United    O
States    O
Navy    O
began    O
building    O
a    O
series    O
of    O
battlecruisers    B-Cruiser103140900
in    O
the    O
1920s    O
,    O
more    O
than    O
a    O
decade    O
after    O
their    O
slower    O
and    O
less    O
heavily    O
armed    O
armored    B-Cruiser103140900
cruiser    I-Cruiser103140900
had    O
been    O
rendered    O
obsolete    O
by    O
the    O
Royal    O
Navy    O
's    O
battlecruisers    O
.    O

The    O
treaty    O
forestalled    O
any    O
further    O
development    O
of    O
battlecruisers    O
for    O
the    O
next    O
decade    O
and    O
a    O
half    O
,    O
but    O
a    O
number    O
of    O
countries    O
experimented    O
with    O
"    O
cruiser-killer    B-Cruiser103140900
"    O
ships    O
in    O
the    O
late    O
1930s    O
that    O
were    O
designed    O
to    O
destroy    O
the    O
post    O
-    O
London    O
Naval    O
Treaty    O
heavy    O
cruisers    O
.    O

These    O
ships    O
had    O
been    O
made    O
obsolete    O
by    O
the    O
adoption    O
of    O
oil    O
-    O
firing    O
and    O
the    O
steam    O
turbine    O
engine    O
and    O
had    O
been    O
superseded    O
by    O
the    O
battlecruiser    B-Cruiser103140900
and    O
the    O
light    B-Cruiser103140900
cruiser    I-Cruiser103140900
.    O

In    O
1914    O
,    O
he    O
was    O
promoted    O
to    O
lieutenant    O
and    O
was    O
assigned    O
to    O
the    O
battlecruiser    B-Cruiser103140900
,    O
followed    O
by    O
the    O
destroyer    O
.    O

When    O
the    O
armoured    O
cruiser    O
was    O
supplanted    O
by    O
the    O
battlecruiser    B-Cruiser103140900
,    O
an    O
intermediate    O
ship    O
type    O
between    O
this    O
and    O
the    O
light    O
cruiser    O
was    O
found    O
to    O
be    O
needed    O
—    O
one    O
larger    O
and    O
more    O
powerful    O
than    O
the    O
light    O
cruisers    O
of    O
a    O
potential    O
enemy    O
but    O
not    O
as    O
large    O
and    O
expensive    O
as    O
the    O
battlecruiser    O
so    O
as    O
to    O
be    O
built    O
in    O
sufficient    O
numbers    O
to    O
protect    O
merchant    O
ships    O
and    O
serve    O
in    O
a    O
number    O
of    O
combat    O
theaters    O
.    O

The    O
result    O
was    O
the    O
battlecruiser    B-Cruiser103140900

back    O
to    O
the    O

when    O

when    O
the    O
restrictions    O
of    O
the    O
