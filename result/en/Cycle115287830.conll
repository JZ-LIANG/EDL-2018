In    O

Designed    O
specifically    O
for    O
railroad    O

,    O
this    O
was    O
a    O
supercharged    O
2    O

45    O

type    O

with    O
an    O
,    O
bore    O
by    O
stroke    B-Cycle115287830

giving    O
displacement    O
per    O
cylinder    O
.    O

The    O
earliest    O
IOE    O
layouts    O
used    O
atmospheric    O
inlet    O
valves    O
which    O
were    O
held    O
closed    O
with    O
a    O
weak    O
spring    O
and    O
were    O
opened    O
by    O
the    O
pressure    O
differential    O
created    O
when    O
the    O
piston    O
went    O
down    O
on    O
the    O
inlet    B-Cycle115287830
stroke    I-Cycle115287830
.    O

The    O
problem    O
increases    O
with    O
larger    O
engine    O
displacements    O
,    O
since    O
larger    O
displacement    O
is    O
achieved    O
with    O
a    O
longer    O
piston    B-Cycle115287830
stroke    I-Cycle115287830
,    O
which    O
increases    O
the    O
difference    O
in    O
acceleration    O
—    O
or    O
by    O
a    O
larger    O
bore    O
,    O
which    O
increases    O
the    O
mass    O
of    O
the    O
pistons    O
.    O

This    O
DOHC    O
24-valve    O
V6    O
has    O
bore    O
and    O
stroke    B-Cycle115287830
dimensions    O
of    O
76    O
mm    O
and    O
73.3    O
mm    O
respectively    O
,    O
along    O
with    O
a    O
compression    O
ratio    O
ranging    O
from    O
9.5    O
to    O
10.0:1    O
.    O

The    O
difference    O
is    O
that    O
the    O
recovery    O
stroke    O
is    O
at    O
90    O
degrees    O
to    O
the    O
power    B-Cycle115287830
stroke    I-Cycle115287830
,    O
so    O
that    O
the    O
cilia    O
avoid    O
hitting    O
each    O
other    O
