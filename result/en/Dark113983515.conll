According    O
to    O
Master    O
of    O
Wine    O
Jancis    O
Robinson    O
,    O
Abouriou    O
tends    O
to    O
produce    O
deeply    B-Dark113983515
colored    I-Dark113983515
and    O
very    O
spicy    O
red    O
wines    O
that    O
can    O
be    O
tannic    O
but    O
often    O
lack    O
acidity    O
.    O

The    O
grape    O
was    O
prized    O
for    O
the    O
color    B-Dark113983515
and    O
concentration    O
it    O
added    O
even    O
though    O
viticulture    O
and    O
cultivation    O
could    O
be    O
difficult    O
due    O
to    O
its    O
extremely    O
hard    O
wood    O
stock    O
.    O

After    O
harvest    O
the    O
grapes    O
are    O
destemmed    O
and    O
crushed    O
with    O
a    O
short    O
maceration    O
period    O
,    O
often    O
with    O
the    O
must    O
warmed    O
up    O
to    O
aid    O
in    O
extraction    O
of    O
color    B-Dark113983515
and    O
phenolics    O
before    O
the    O
wines    O
are    O
pressed    O
and    O
put    O
into    O
barrel    O
.    O

The    O
color    B-Dark113983515
of    I-Dark113983515
wine    I-Dark113983515
is    O
not    O
determined    O
by    O
the    O
juice    O
of    O
the    O
grape    O
,    O
which    O
is    O
almost    O
always    O
clear    O
,    O
but    O
rather    O
by    O
the    O
presence    O
or    O
absence    O
of    O
the    O
grape    O
skin    O
during    O
fermentation    O
.    O

For    O
example    O
,    O
the    O
wine    O
may    O
be    O
tasted    O
from    O
a    O

However    O
,    O
despite    O

,    O
there    O
is    O
some    O
doubt    O

the    O

to    O
the    O
color    B-Dark113983515
of    I-Dark113983515
the    I-Dark113983515
