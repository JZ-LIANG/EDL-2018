,    O
the    O
British    O

(    O

began    O
to    O

The    O
shock    O
of    O
the    O
attack    O
coming    O
in    O
an    O
unexpected    O
place    O
,    O
with    O
such    O
devastating    O
results    O
and    O
without    O

a    O
declaration    B-Declaration106725877

the    O
attack    O

In    O
the    O
following    O
month    O
(    O
December    O

formally    O
declared    B-Declaration106725877

and    O
dispatched    O
a    O

to    O
invade    O
Mato    O

.    O

Ultimately    O
,    O
the    O
government    O
found    O
itself    O
with    O
no    O
alternative    O
but    O
to    O
declare    B-Declaration106725877

However    O
,    O
that    O
