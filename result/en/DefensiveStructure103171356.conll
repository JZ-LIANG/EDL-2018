In    O
the    O

the    O

The    O
end    O
of    O
the    O
early    O
Middle    O
Ages    O
was    O
the    O
time    O
that    O
the    O
Welsh    O
language    O
transitioned    O
from    O
the    O
Primitive    O
Welsh    O
spoken    O
throughout    O
the    O
era    O
into    O
Old    O
Welsh    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
time    O
when    O
the    O
modern    O
England    O
–    O
Wales    O
border    O
would    O
take    O
its    O
near    O
-    O
final    O
form    O
,    O
a    O
line    O
broadly    O
followed    O
by    O
Offa's    B-DefensiveStructure103171356

eighth    O

An    O
alternative    O
suggestion    O
is    O
that    O
it    O
derives    O
from    O
Welsh    O
words    O
"    O
ystre    O
"    O
,    O
meaning    O
boundary    O
or    O
dyke    O
,    O
and    O
"    O
gwyl    O
"    O
,    O
meaning    O
watch    O
or    O
guard    O
;    O
a    O
combined    O
word    O
"    O
ystregwyl    O
"    O
could    O
mean    O
"    O
well    O

guarded    O
border    O
(    O
or    O
dyke    O
)    O

by    O

of    O

Norman    O
origin    O

with    O
late    O

correctly    O
concluding    O
that    O
the    O

—    O
probably    O
simply    O
owing    O

Edward    O

derived    O

Alfred    O
expanded    O
the    O

centre    O
of    O
Alfred    O
's    O

Bonus    O
,    O
Patriarch    O
Sergius    O
,    O
and    O
many    O
people    O
came    O
to    O
the    O
Golden    B-DefensiveStructure103171356

by    O
the    O
Avars    O
themselves    O
.    O

The    O
Byzantines    O
also    O
famously    O
constructed    O
the    O
Walls    B-DefensiveStructure103171356
of    I-DefensiveStructure103171356
Constantinople    I-DefensiveStructure103171356
which    O
featured    O
double    O
layers    O
of    O
walls    O
through    O
most    O
of    O
its    O
perimeter    O
and    O
a    O
moat    O
.    O

The    O
principle    O
of    O
an    O
outer    O
and    O
inner    O
wall    O
was    O
also    O
used    O
in    O
fortified    O
cities    O
,    O
such    O
as    O
the    O
Theodosian    B-DefensiveStructure103171356
Walls    I-DefensiveStructure103171356
of    O
Constantinople    O
and    O
the    O
city    O
wall    O
of    O
Carcassonne    O
.    O

After    O
being    O
paraded    O
through    O
Constantinople    O
in    O
chains    O
,    O
Heraclius    O
and    O
many    O
of    O
his    O
senior    O
-    O
most    O
officers    O
were    O
then    O
hanged    O
from    O
the    O
city    B-DefensiveStructure103171356
walls    I-DefensiveStructure103171356
,    O
while    O
Leontius    O
and    O
Tiberius    O
were    O
executed    O
in    O
early    O
706    O
.    O

In    O
later    O
centuries    O
,    O
it    O
was    O
said    O
that    O
the    O
Emperor    O
hurried    O
to    O
the    O
church    O
at    O
Blachernae    O
and    O
had    O
the    O
robe    O
of    O
the    O
Theotokos    O
carried    O
in    O
procession    O
along    O
the    O
Theodosian    B-DefensiveStructure103171356
Walls    I-DefensiveStructure103171356
.    O

The    O
city    O
was    O
severely    O
depopulated    O
due    O
to    O
the    O
general    O
economic    O
and    O
territorial    O
decline    O
of    O
the    O
empire    O
,    O
and    O
by    O
1453    O
consisted    O
of    O
a    O
series    O
of    O
walled    O
villages    O
separated    O
by    O
vast    O
fields    O
encircled    O
by    O
the    O
fifth    O
-    O
century    O
Theodosian    B-DefensiveStructure103171356
walls    I-DefensiveStructure103171356
.    O

The    O
city    O
had    O
about    O
20    O

The    O
marriage    O
is    O
disputed    O
by    O
some    O
sectors    O

it    O
