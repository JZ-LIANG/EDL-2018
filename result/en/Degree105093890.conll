In    O
music    O
a    O
distance    O
model    O
is    O
the    O
alternation    O
of    O
two    O
different    O
intervals    O
to    O
create    O
a    O
non    O

diatonic    O
musical    O
mode    O
such    O
as    O
the    O

by    O
what    O

a    O

"    O
to    O
be    O
heard    O
only    O
once    O
,    O
and    O
that    O
Schubert    O

to    O

that    O

Canine    O
TVTs    O
were    O
initially    O
described    O
by    O
Russian    O
veterinarian    B-Degree105093890
M.A.    O
Novinsky    O
(    O
1841–1914    O
)    O
in    O
1876    O
,    O
when    O
he    O
demonstrated    O
that    O
the    O
tumor    O
could    O
be    O
transplanted    O
from    O
one    O
dog    O
to    O
another    O
by    O
infecting    O
them    O
with    O
tumor    O
cells    O
.    O

When    O
,    O
despite    O
these    O
precautions    O
,    O
animals    O
still    O
become    O
sick    O
,    O
they    O
are    O
treated    O
with    O
veterinary    O
medicines    O
,    O
by    O

This    O
is    O
due    O
to    O
their    O
inability    O
to    O
produce    O
normal    O
tyrosinase    O
,    O
a    O

Commercial    O
pet    O
groomers    O
and    O

considered    O
to    O

dermal    O
absorption    O
during    O
the    O

they    O
may    O

because    O
