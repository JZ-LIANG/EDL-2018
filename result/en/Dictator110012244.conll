was    O
a    O

who    O
first    O
used    O
it    O
permanently    O
–    O
according    O
to    O
Dio    O
,    O
this    O
was    O
a    O
singular    O

excessive    O
form    O
of    O
flattery    O
granted    O
by    O

In    O

Beorn    O
tells    O
Gandalf    O
of    O
the    O
alliance    O
between    O

Orcs    O
of    O

near    O

High    O

Gandalf    O
feared    O
that    O
Sauron    B-Dictator110012244
could    O
use    O
Smaug    O
as    O
a    O
weapon    O
,    O
and    O
was    O
concerned    O
that    O
Thorin    O
's    O
pride    O
and    O
quick    O
temper    O
would    O
ruin    O
the    O

destroy    O
the    O

Dale    O
was    O
overrun    O
by    O
Sauron    B-Dictator110012244
's    O
northern    O
army    O
,    O
and    O
many    O
dwarves    O
and    O
men    O
took    O
refuge    O
in    O
Erebor    O
,    O
which    O
was    O
promptly    O
surrounded    O
.    O

Reasons    O
for    O
this    O
trek    O
are    O
unknown    O
,    O
but    O
they    O
possibly    O
had    O
to    O
do    O
with    O
Sauron    B-Dictator110012244
's    O
growing    O
power    O
in    O
nearby    O
Greenwood    O
,    O
which    O
later    O
became    O
known    O
as    O
Mirkwood    O
as    O
a    O
result    O
of    O
the    O
shadow    O
that    O
fell    O
upon    O
it    O
during    O

's    O
search    O
of    O
the    O
forest    O
for    O
the    O
One    O
Ring    O
.    O

They    O
were    O
nine    O
men    O
who    O
succumbed    O
to    O
Sauron    B-Dictator110012244
's    O
power    O
and    O
attained    O
near    O
-    O
immortality    O
as    O
wraiths    O
,    O
servants    O
bound    O
to    O

completely    O
under    O

dominion    O
of    O
Sauron    B-Dictator110012244

Ultimately    O
,    O
however    O
,    O
they    O
were    O
bound    O
to    O
the    O
One    O
Ring    O
and    O
completely    O
enslaved    O
by    O
the    O

of    O

Julius    B-Dictator110012244

culprits    O
,    O
Julius    B-Dictator110012244
Caesar    I-Dictator110012244
swayed    O
many    O
by    O

that    O
they    O
should    O
be    O
exiled    O
to    O

his    O
last    O
years    O
in    O

,    O
Caesar    B-Dictator110012244
rightly    O
feared    O

might    O
put    O
him    O

,    O
who    O
did    O
not    O
put    O
the    O
decree    O
into    O
question    O
altogether    O
,    O
but    O
its    O
ability    O
to    O

the    O
popular    O

By    O
that    O
time    O
,    O
the    O

will    O
be    O

it    O

an    O

is    O
more    O
closely    O
associated    O
with    O

,    O
Brutus    O
the    O
assassin    O
of    O
Caesar    B-Dictator110012244
is    O
depicted    O
as    O
a    O
man    O
who    O
has    O
always    O
believed    O
in    O
honor    O
,    O
virtue    O
and    O
liberty    O
and    O
who    O
has    O
ultimately    O
sacrificed    O
everything    O
for    O

ideals    O

The    O
technique    O
was    O
so    O
named    O
because    O
,    O
though    O
its    O
presence    O
is    O
attested    O
in    O
protohistoric    O
times    O
,    O
its    O
use    O
was    O
common    O
enough    O
in    O
Gaul    O
to    O
merit    O
mention    O
in    O
Julius    B-Dictator110012244

the    O

ensued    O
are    O
roughly    O
