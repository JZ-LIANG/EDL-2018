assumed    O
by    O
some    O
to    O
have    O
come    O
from    O

due    O
to    O
the    O

a    O
quadruped    B-DomesticAnimal101317541

it    O

were    O
quadrupedal    B-DomesticAnimal101317541

facultatively    O
bipedal    O

It    O
is    O
primarily    O
quadrupedal    B-DomesticAnimal101317541

although    O
it    O

Some    O

The    O
presence    O

it    O
more    O

it    O
