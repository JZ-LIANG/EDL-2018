claimed    O
that    O
the    O
M184V    O
mutation    O
reduces    O
"    O
viral    O
fitness    O
"    O
,    O
because    O
of    O
the    O
finding    O
that    O
continued    O
lamivudine    O
treatment    O
causes    O
the    O
HIV    O
viral    O
load    O
to    O
rebound    O
but    O
at    O
a    O
much    O
lower    O
level    O
,    O
and    O
that    O
withdrawal    O
of    O
lamivudine    O
results    O
in    O
a    O
higher    O
viral    O
load    O
rebound    O
with    O
rapid    O
loss    O
of    O
the    O

mutation    O
;    O
GSK    O
therefore    O
argued    O
that    O
there    O
may    O
be    O
benefit    O
in    O
continuing    O
lamivudine    O
treatment    O
even    O
in    O
the    O
presence    O
of    O
high    O
level    O
resistance    O
,    O
because    O
