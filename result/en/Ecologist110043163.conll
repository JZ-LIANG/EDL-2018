Among    O

partially    O

it    O
required    O
only    O
a    O
few    O
wild    O
acres    O
for    O
J.    O

more    O

resistant    O

"    O
The    O
answer    O
was    O
that    O
the    O
wild    O
prairie    O
had    O
a    O
much    O
more    O
complex    O

more    O

this    O
could    O
