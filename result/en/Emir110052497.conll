Despite    O
his    O
successes    O
,    O
Afshin    O
's    O
star    O
began    O
to    O
decline    O
,    O
apparently    O
as    O
a    O
result    O
of    O
his    O
jealousy    O

the    O
governor    O
of    O

Afshin    O
apparently    O
regarded    O
as    O
an    O
upstart    O

a    O
rival    O
for    O

had    O
become    O
a    O
mere    O
