The    O

areas    O
of    O
controversy    O
related    O
to    O
genetically    O
modified    O
food    O
(    O
GM    O
food    O
or    O
GMO    O
food    O
)    O
are    O
whether    O
such    O
food    O
should    O
be    O
labeled    O
,    O
the    O
role    O
of    O
government    O
regulators    O
,    O
the    O
objectivity    O
of    O
scientific    O
research    O
and    O
publication    O
,    O
the    O
effect    O
of    O
genetically    O
modified    O
crops    O
on    O
health    O
and    O
the    O
environment    O
,    O
the    O
effect    O
on    O
pesticide    B-EpidemicDisease114130166
resistance    I-EpidemicDisease114130166
,    O
the    O
impact    O
of    O
such    O
crops    O
for    O
farmers    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
role    O
of    O
the    O
crops    O
in    O
feeding    O
the    O
world    O
population    O
.    O

In    O
response    O
,    O
it    O
has    O
been    O
argued    O
that    O
the    O
genes    O
that    O
enhance    O
a    O
crop    O
in    O
some    O
way    O
,    O
such    O
as    O
drought    O
resistance    O
or    O
pesticide    B-EpidemicDisease114130166
resistance    I-EpidemicDisease114130166
,    O
are    O
not    O
believed    O
to    O
affect    O
the    O
food    O
itself    O
.    O

This    O
accelerated    O
reproductive    O
rate    O
allows    O
spider    O
mite    O
populations    O
to    O
adapt    O
quickly    O
to    O
resist    B-EpidemicDisease114130166
pesticides    I-EpidemicDisease114130166
,    O
so    O
chemical    O
control    O
methods    O
can    O
become    O
somewhat    O
ineffectual    O
when    O
the    O
same    O
pesticide    O
is    O
used    O
over    O
a    O
prolonged    O
period    O
.    O

Drawbacks    O
include    O
high    O
potential    O
for    O
development    O
of    O
resistance    B-EpidemicDisease114130166
in    O
mite    O
populations    O
,    O
as    O
has    O
been    O
observed    O
in    O
previous    O
generations    O
of    O
miticides    O
,    O
and    O
toxicity    O
of    O
some    O
miticides    O
towards    O
fish    O
.    O

However    O
the    O
same    O
techniques    O
can    O
be    O
used    O
to    O
increase    O
pesticide    B-EpidemicDisease114130166
resistance    I-EpidemicDisease114130166

Another    O
