first    O
introduced    O
by    O
Steven    B-Ethologist110065911

as    O
a    O
metaphor    O
for    O
the    O
idea    O
that    O
children    O
are    O
innately    O
equipped    O
with    O
mental    O
processes    O
that    O
help    O
initiate    O

Bootstrapping    O
attempts    O
to    O
identify    O
the    O
language    O
learning    O
processes    O
that    O
enable    O
children    O
to    O
learn    O
about    O

structure    O
of    O

Ivan    B-Ethologist110065911

regarding    O
the    O

Both    O
Ivan    B-Ethologist110065911
Pavlov    I-Ethologist110065911
and    O
Bekhterev    O
independently    O
developed    O
a    O
theory    O
of    O
conditioned    O
reflexes    O
which    O
describe    O
automatic    O
responses    O

the    O

Ivan    B-Ethologist110065911
Pavlov    I-Ethologist110065911
had    O
himself    O
induced    O
an    O
altered    O
state    O
in    O
pigeons    O
,    O
that    O
he    O
referred    O
to    O

"    O
which    O
some    O

believe    O
was    O
some    O
form    O

state    O

Ivan    B-Ethologist110065911

this    O

In    O
1927    O
Ivan    B-Ethologist110065911

wrote    O
that    O

that    O

of    O

was    O
too    O

,    O

decided    O
that    O

Key    O
ideas    O
that    O
sparked    O
changes    O
in    O

were    O
the    O
fast    O
progress    O
of    O
science    O
;    O
evolution    O
,    O

;    O
and    O
what    O
might    O
now    O
be    O
called    O
emergent    O
order    O
,    O

discussed    O
the    O
electric    O
organ    O
in    O
his    O
"    O

a    O
likely    O
example    O
of    O

:    O
"    O
But    O
if    O
the    O
electric    O
organs    O
had    O
been    O
inherited    O
from    O
one    O
ancient    O
progenitor    O
thus    O
provided    O
,    O
we    O
might    O

expected    O
that    O
all    O
electric    O
fishes    O
would    O
have    O
been    O
specially    O
related    O
to    O

other    O

I    O
am    O
inclined    O
to    O

working    O
for    O
the    O

being    O
and    O
taking    O
advantage    O
of    O
analogous    O
variations    O
,    O
has    O
sometimes    O
modified    O
in    O
very    O
nearly    O
the    O

manner    O

The    O
basic    O
principle    O
of    O
evolution    O
via    O
natural    O

was    O
outlined    O
by    O

with    O
the    O
work    O
of    O
Joseph    O

he    O
set    O

of    O

his    O

widely    O
recognized    O
until    O
Charles    B-Ethologist110065911
Darwin    I-Ethologist110065911

used    O
the    O

a    O

for    O
the    O
period    O
within    O
the    O

from    O
the    O
1880s    O

around    O
1920    O

when    O
alternatives    O
to    O
natural    O
selection    O
were    O
developed    O

explored    O
—    O
as    O
many    O
biologists    O
considered    O
natural    O
selection    O
to    O
have    O
been    O
a    O
