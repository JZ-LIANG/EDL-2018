American    O
General    O

recognized    O

of    O
the    O
capture    O
of    O

York    O
City    O
,    O
and    O
withdrew    B-Euphemism106605046

of    O
his    O
army    O
about    O
north    O
to    O
Harlem    O
Heights    O
.    O

The    O
Army    O
indicated    O
that    O
it    O
had    O
previously    O
claimed    O
the    O
town    O
in    O
September    O

reason    O
in    O
September    O

During    O
its    O
withdrawal    B-Euphemism106605046
,    O
the    O
Yugoslav    O
People    O

(    O

with    O
explosives    O

detonating    O
them    O

When    O
they    O
were    O
beaten    O
at    O
the    O
Battle    O
of    O

in    O
1634    O
and    O
forced    O
to    O
withdraw    B-Euphemism106605046

they    O
brought    O
death    O
and    O
depravity    O
to    O
the    O
Glan    O
area    O
in    O
1635    O
.    O

The    O
generals    O
agreed    O
unanimously    O
with    O
Mifflin    O
that    O
retreat    B-Euphemism106605046
was    O
the    O
best    O
option    O
and    O
Washington    O
had    O
orders    O
go    O
out    O
by    O
the    O
evening    O
.    O

This    O
decision    O
allowed    O
General    O
Washington    O
to    O
successfully    O
orchestrate    O
a    O
nighttime    O
strategic    O

The    O

of    O
Ochakov    O
ordered    O
the    O
ships    O
to    O
leave    O
after    O
the    O

so    O
that    O
the    O

would    O
not    O
contemplate    O

By    O
the    O
27th    O
of    O
June    O
,    O
believing    O
that    O
he    O
was    O
vastly    O
outnumbered    O
,    O
General    O
McClellan    O
decided    O
to    O
pull    O
his    O
army    O
back    O
to    O
the    O

She    O
was    O
asked    O
whether    O
it    O
would    O
be    O
appropriate    O
to    O
promote    O
masturbation    B-Euphemism106605046
as    O
a    O
means    O
of    O
preventing    O
young    O

engaging    O
in    O
riskier    O
forms    O
of    O
sexual    O
activity    O
,    O
and    O
she    O
replied    O
,    O
"    O

think    O
that    O
it    O

it    O

However    O
,    O
Labor    O
was    O

The    O
curse    O
of    O

is    O
the    O
belief    O
,    O
in    O
some    O

Afghanistan    O
,    O
that    O
the    O
number    O

is    O
cursed    O
or    O
a    O
badge    O
of    O

it    O
is    O
purportedly    O
linked    O
with    O

The    O
inherent    O
xenophobia    O
of    O
the    O

also    O
stemmed    O

She    O
argues    O
that    O
radical    O

probably    O
generalize    O
too    O
widely    O
as    O
far    O
as    O
women    O
are    O
concerned    O
and    O
do    O
not    O
take    O
into    O
consideration    O
more    O
complicated    O
circumstances    O
such    O
as    O

The    O

explains    O
the    O
different    O
view    O
Spiritism    O
has    O
on    O
the    O
subject    O
,    O
stating    O
that    O

misconcepts    O

that    O
the    O
state    O
of    O
the    O
spirits    O
after    O
their    O
death    O
is    O
not    O
definitive    O

that    O
there    O

for    O

Conditionalism    O
is    O
usually    O
paired    O
with    O
mortalism    O
and    O
annihilationism    O
,    O
the    O
belief    O
that    O
the    O
unsaved    O
will    O
be    O
ultimately    O
destroyed    O
and    O
cease    O
to    O
exist    O
,    O
rather    O
than    O
suffer    O
unending    O
torment    O

In    O
1953    O
,    O
a    O
radio    O
speech    O
by    O
Hallesby    O
caused    O
a    O
major    O
debate    O
in    O
Norway    O
on    O
the    O
existence    O
of    O

The    O
song    O
's    O
subject    O
is    O
that    O
of    O
a    O
phone    O
call    O
from    O
someone    O
in    O
Hell    B-Euphemism106605046
who    O
enjoys    O
being    O
there    O
and    O
telling    O
the    O
person    O
on    O
the    O
other    O
line    O
what    O
he    O
has    O
learned    O
.    O
"    O

Finally    O
he    O
reveals    O
that    O
Malcolm    O
Betruger    O
,    O
chief    O
Delta    O
Labs    O
scientist    O
,    O
is    O
working    O
for    O
the    O
demons    O
and    O
took    O
the    O
cube    O
into    O
the    O
demon    O
's    O
dimension    O
,    O
now    O
nicknamed    O
as    O
hell    B-Euphemism106605046
.    O

Notably    O
,    O
he    O
argued    O
for    O
Aristotle    O
's    O
salvation    O
against    O
the    O
scholarly    O
consensus    O
that    O
Aristotle    O
was    O
in    O
Hell    B-Euphemism106605046
.    O

If    O
everyone    O
thought    O
the    O
same    O
way    O
then    O
that    O
would    O
be    O

that    O
emphasized    O

love    O
rather    O
than    O
human    O
sinfulness    O

On    O

heaven    O

hell    B-Euphemism106605046
-    O
by    O

incorrect    O
and    O
not    O
in    O
line    O
with    O
Biblical    O
teachings    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
concept    O
of    O
a    O
heaven    O
that    O
only    O
some    O
can    O
enter    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
alternative    O
of    O
a    O
burning    O
eternity    O
in    O
Hell    O
,    O
presupposes    O
God    O
not    O
as    O
a    O
being    O
of    O
love    O
,    O
but    O
an    O
entity    O
who    O
torments    O

out    O
of    O
pure    O
sadism    O
,    O

as    O
such    O

that    O

rather    O
than    O
on    O

The    O

asks    O
them    O

he    O

it    O

a    O
euphemism    B-Euphemism106605046

in    O
many    O

even    O
where    O
some    O

are    O
offended    O
by    O
certain    O
terms    O
,    O
others    O
may    O
be    O
offended    O
by    O
the    O
replacement    B-Euphemism106605046

such    O
terms    O
with    O
what    O
they    O
consider    O
to    O
be    O
euphemisms    O
(    O
e.g.    O
