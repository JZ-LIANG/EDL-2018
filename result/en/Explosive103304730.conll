,    O
gunpowder    B-Explosive103304730
from    O

up    O
to    O
the    O
development    O
of    O
gunpowder    B-Explosive103304730
,    O
they    O
were    O
made    O
largely    O
of    O

,    O
using    O
rope    O

to    O

them    O
,    O
possibly    O
with    O

pieces    O
of    O
metal    O
at    O
key    O

With    O
the    O
advent    O
of    O
gunpowder    B-Explosive103304730
,    O
firearms    O
such    O
as    O

and    O
cannon    O
—    O
eventually    O
the    O
mortar    O
and    O
artillery    O
—    O
were    O
developed    O
.    O

Express    O
rifles    O
used    O
larger    O
powder    O
charges    O
and    O
lighter    O
bullets    O
than    O
typical    O
for    O
the    O

at    O
the    O
time    O
to    O
load    O
cannons    O
.    O

Each    O
man    O
typically    O
took    O
a    O
rifle    O

shotgun    O
(    O

The    O
wheellock    O
works    O
by    O
spinning    O
a    O

-    O
loaded    O
steel    O
wheel    O
against    O
a    O
piece    O
of    O

to    O
generate    O
intense    O
sparks    O
,    O
which    O
ignite    O
gunpowder    B-Explosive103304730

Among    O
the    O
advantages    O

be    O
fired    O
by    O
applying    O
a    O

this    O
had    O
to    O
be    O
done    O

at    O
the    O
moment    O
of    O
firing    O

in    O
some    O
cases    O
required    O
a    O

to    O
fire    O
the    O

The    O
flash    O
from    O
the    O
pan    O
travels    O
through    O
the    O

Eventually    O
the    O

were    O
overwhelmed    O
and    O
their    O
positions    O
were    O
overrun    O

The    O
Ottomans    O
ultimately    O

due    O
to    O
the    O

After    O
graduating    O
with    O
the    O
class    O
of    O
1886    O
,    O
he    O
worked    O
in    O
several    O

This    O
was    O
not    O
only    O
to    O
lower    O
the    O
outline    O
of    O
the    O
fortress    O
,    O
but    O
also    O
because    O
guns    O
of    O
this    O
period    O
were    O
rifled    O
muzzle    O

(    O

,    O
still    O
using    O
black    B-Explosive103304730
powder    I-Explosive103304730
as    O
their    O
propellant    O
,    O
which    O
generated    O
large    O

of    O
fumes    O

He    O
went    O

They    O
were    O

they    O

Modern    O

came    O
to    O
the    O
realization    O
that    O
an    O
ignition    O
could    O
be    O
caused    O
by    O
the    O
mixing    O
of    O
certain    O
nitrates    O
and    O
sulphuric    O
acid    O

arrested    O
the    O

during    O

many    O
advantageous    O
features    O
,    O
the    O
Lee    O
–    O
Metford    O
was    O
something    O
of    O
an    O
anachronism    O
,    O
due    O
to    O
its    O
use    O
of    O

Towards    O
the    O
latter    O
part    O
of    O
the    O
period    O
,    O
gunpowder    B-Explosive103304730
was    O
invented    O
,    O
which    O
increased    O
the    O
sophistication    O
of    O
the    O
weapons    O
,    O
and    O
led    O
to    O
the    O
eventual    O
development    O
of    O
the    O
cannon    O
and    O
other    O
firearms    O
.    O

From    O
the    O
15th    O
century    O
,    O
gunpowder    B-Explosive103304730
was    O
also    O
used    O
,    O
although    O
the    O
aim    O
remained    O
to    O
burn    O
the    O
props    O
.    O

Fire    O
ships    O
containing    O
straw    O
and    O
powder    B-Explosive103304730
were    O
also    O
used    O
during    O
the    O
Chinese    O
Battle    O
of    O
Lake    O
Poyang    O
in    O
1363    O

(    O
also    O
called    O

was    O
added    O
to    O
the    O
mixture    O
in    O
the    O
Islamic    O
world    O
,    O
and    O
China    O
developed    O
a    O
dry    O
saltpetre    O
mixture    O
in    O
the    O
12th    O
century    O
,    O

eventually    O
became    O
gunpowder    B-Explosive103304730

Like    O
the    O
sieges    O
of    O
old    O
,    O
the    O
British    O
were    O
met    O
by    O
incendiary    O
weapons    O
,    O
but    O
now    O
these    O
took    O
the    O
form    O
of    O
explosive    O
grenades    O

mines    O
and    O

Its    O

was    O
highly    O
unsafe    O
,    O
especially    O
the    O

and    O
are    O

The    O

UDMH    O
is    O
toxic    O
and    O
carcinogenic    O
,    O
but    O
is    O
used    O
in    O
rocketry    O
because    O
this    O
combination    O
of    O
fuel    O
and    O
oxidizer    O
is    O
hypergolic    B-Explosive103304730

not    O
require    O
an    O

According    O
to    O
preliminary    O
examinations    O
by    O
the    O
explosive    O
experts    O
of    O
the    O
Lebanese    O
Army    O
,    O
the    O
car    O
had    O
been    O
rigged    O
with    O
explosives    O
equivalent    O
to    O
30    O
kilograms    B-Explosive103304730
of    I-Explosive103304730
TNT    I-Explosive103304730
.    O

The    O
Mark    O
17    O
had    O
a    O
yield    O
in    O
the    O
range    O
of    O
15    O
to    O
20    O
megatons    O
TNT    B-Explosive103304730
equivalent    I-Explosive103304730
.    O

Its    O
minimum    O
yield    O
was    O
specified    O
at    O
four    O
megatons    B-Explosive103304730
.    O

It    O
had    O
two    O
yields    O
;    O
10    O
and    O
25    O
kt    B-Explosive103304730
.    O

The    O
yield    O
was    O
3.3    O
megatons    B-Explosive103304730
.    O

Predicted    O
yield    O
was    O
1.75    O
megatons    B-Explosive103304730
;    O
the    O
actual    O
yield    O
was    O
1.37    O
megatons    O
with    O
the    O
shortfall    O
due    O
to    O
poor    O
burning    O
of    O
the    O
secondary    O
.    O

However    O
,    O
modern    O
nuclear    O
weapons    O
use    O
fusion    O
boosting    O
,    O
which    O
mitigates    O
the    O
predetonation    O
problem    O
;    O
if    O
the    O
pit    O
can    O
generate    O
a    O
nuclear    O
weapon    O
yield    O
of    O
even    O
a    O
fraction    O
of    O
a    O
kiloton    B-Explosive103304730
,    O
which    O
is    O
enough    O
to    O
start    O
deuterium    O
-    O
tritium    O
fusion    O
,    O
the    O
resulting    O
burst    O
of    O
neutrons    O
will    O
fission    O
enough    O
plutonium    O
to    O
ensure    O
a    O
yield    O
of    O
tens    O
of    O
kilotons    O
