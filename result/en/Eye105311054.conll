Classical    O

long    O
preceded    O
the    O

that    O

quantized    O
,    O
when    O
Albert    O

In    O

Lenses    O
can    O

be    O

then    O

Another    O
consequence    O
of    O
this    O

is    O
that    O
the    O

varies    O
in    O

This    O
is    O
because    O
,    O
when    O
the    O

is    O
smaller    O
than    O
the    O
eye    O

diameter    O
,    O
the    O
aperture    O
itself    O
becomes    O
the    O

dominated    O
by    O

Nitrate    O

was    O
used    O
for    O
X-ray    B-Eye105311054
photography    O
for    O
some    O
time    O
,    O
where    O
its    O

was    O
most    O
acute    O
,    O
and    O
thus    O
in    O
1933    O
,    O
became    O
disused    O
for    O
such    O
purposes    O

In    O
1970    O
,    O
Wilhelm    O
Stürmer    O
,    O
a    O
chemical    O
physicist    O
and    O
radiologist    O
at    O
Siemens    O
,    O
developed    O
a    O
new    O
method    O
to    O
examine    O
the    O
Hunsrück    O

40    O

He    O
created    O
high    O

resolution    O
movies    O
and    O
stereoscopic    O
images    O
of    O
unopened    O
slates    O
,    O
which    O
showed    O
complex    O
details    O
of    O
soft    O
tissues    O
that    O
can    O
not    O
be    O
made    O
visible    O
with    O
conventional    O
methods    O
.    O

X-rays    B-Eye105311054
show    O
only    O
bone    O
injuries    O
and    O
are    O
therefore    O
not    O
very    O
helpful    O
in    O
diagnosing    O
cartilage    O
damage    O
,    O
especially    O
not    O
in    O
early    O
stages    O

But    O
the    O
realization    O
that    O
trains    O
of    O
electromagnetic    O
waves    O
could    O
produce    O
some    O
pressure    O
,    O
in    O
combination    O
with    O
the    O
penetrating    O
power    O
of    O
Röntgen    O
rays    O
(    O
now    O
called    O
x-ray    B-Eye105311054
)    O
,    O
led    O
him    O
to    O
conclude    O
that    O
nothing    O
argues    O
against    O
the    O
possible    O
existence    O
of    O
even    O
more    O
penetrating    O
radiation    O
than    O

said    O
he    O
knew    O
the    O

would    O
reveal    O
a    O
fracture    O
,    O
and    O
he    O
would    O
be    O

also    O
been    O

for    O
medical    O
purposes    O
;    O
however    O
,    O

He    O
also    O
predicted    O
a    O
new    O
mechanism    O
that    O
produces    O
redshift    O
and    O

,    O
that    O
is    O
not    O
due    O
to    O

(    O
Doppler    B-Eye105311054

,    O
that    O
has    O
subsequently    O
been    O
confirmed    O
experimentally    O
(    O
called    O
the    O
Wolf    O
Effect    O
)    O
.    O

The    O
idea    O
was    O
that    O
the    O
doppler    B-Eye105311054
shift    I-Eye105311054
of    O
the    O
signals    O
due    O
to    O
the    O
motion    O
over    O
the    O
ground    O
could    O
be    O
used    O
to    O
determine    O
the    O
ground    O
speed    O
.    O

Astronomical    O
spectrographs    O
have    O
also    O
been    O
developed    O
for    O
the    O
detection    O
of    O

using    O
the    O

shift    I-Eye105311054
of    O
the    O
parent    O

to    O
the    O
radial    O

of    O
the    O
planet    O
around    O
the    O
star    O
.    O

The    O
first    O
reason    O
is    O
that    O
the    O
pole    O
pieces    O
had    O
too    O
much    O
magnetism    O
on    O
the    O

and    O
could    O
cause    O

in    O
frequency    O
in    O
the    O
whistle    O
of    O
a    O
passing    O
train    O
is    O
often    O
used    O
to    O
explain    O
the    O
phenomena    O
of    O
the    O
Doppler    B-Eye105311054
effect    I-Eye105311054
.    O

The    O
gravitational    O
field    O
of    O
the    O
Moon    O
has    O
been    O
measured    O
through    O
tracking    O
the    O
Doppler    B-Eye105311054
shift    I-Eye105311054
of    O
radio    O
signals    O
emitted    O
by    O
orbiting    O
spacecraft    O
.    O

The    O
latter    O
involves    O
covering    O
a    O
certain    O
area    O
and    O
avoiding    O
outage    O
due    O
to    O
co    O
-    O
channel    O
interference    O
,    O

,    O

caused    O
by    O
path    O

and    O

shift    I-Eye105311054
and    O
other    O
forms    O
of    O
distortion    O
.    O

The    O
characteristics    O
of    O
their    O
orbit    O
can    O
be    O
deduced    O
from    O
the    O
Doppler    B-Eye105311054
shift    I-Eye105311054
of    O
radio    O
signals    O
given    O
off    O
by    O
the    O
pulsar    O
.    O

However    O
,    O
there    O
would    O
be    O
some    O
change    O
in    O
the    O
measured    O
signal    O
,    O
because    O
of    O
Doppler    B-Eye105311054
shift    I-Eye105311054
caused    O
by    O
the    O
motion    O
of    O
the    O
Earth    O
.    O

Lastly    O
,    O
the    O
radio    O
communications    O
link    O
could    O
be    O
used    O
to    O
search    O
for    O
gravitational    O
waves    O
(    O
through    O
Doppler    B-Eye105311054
shift    I-Eye105311054
)    O
and    O
to    O
probe    O
the    O
Sun    O
's    O
atmosphere    O
through    O
radio    O
occultation    O
.    O

This    O
phenomenon    O
can    O
be    O
attributed    O
to    O
two    O
important    O
factors    O
:    O
frequency    O
mismatch    O
in    O
the    O
transmitter    O
and    O
the    O
receiver    O
oscillators    O
;    O
and    O
the    O
Doppler    B-Eye105311054
effect    I-Eye105311054
as    O
the    O
transmitter    O
or    O
the    O
receiver    O
is    O
moving    O
.    O

Hence    O
,    O
carrier    O
frequency    O
offset    O
always    O

two    O

axes    O

angles    O

often    O
called    O
"    O
Cartesian    O
polarizers    O
"    O
,    O
since    O
the    O
polarization    O
vectors    O
can    O
be    O
described    O
with    O
simple    O
Cartesian    O
