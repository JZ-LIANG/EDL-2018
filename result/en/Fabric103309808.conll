There    O
was    O

a    O

at    O

around    O

a    O

These    O
included    O

St.    O

prospered    O
during    O
the    O
1830s    O
,    O
when    O
it    O

Over    O
the    O
centuries    O
the    O
mill    O
has    O
been    O
used    O
for    O
corn    O
and    O
for    O
fulling    B-Fabric103309808
woollen    O
cloth    O
;    O
later    O
the    O
site    O
became    O
a    O
rubber    O

belonging    O
to    O
Stephen    O
Moulton    O

In    O
the    O
time    O
of    O
industrialization    O
,    O
cloth    O
weavers    O
from    O
Kusel    O
began    O
walking    B-Fabric103309808
their    O

in    O
Altenglan    O
.    O

In    O
1835    O
,    O
the    O
Altenglan    O
mill    O
was    O
taken    O
over    O
by    O
clothmakers    O
from    O
Kusel    O
,    O
who    O
built    O
it    O
into    O
a    O
walking    B-Fabric103309808

.    O

Early    O
in    O
the    O
13th    O
century    O
his    O
son    O
Robert    O
de    O
Seacourt    O
also    O
granted    O
their    O
tithes    O
to    O
Godstow    O
Abbey    O
,    O
but    O
this    O
time    O
they    O
are    O
described    O
as    O
fulling    B-Fabric103309808

.    O

The    O
village    O
became    O
a    O
centre    O
for    O
cloth    O
manufacture    O
with    O
fulling    B-Fabric103309808
mills    O
being    O
established    O
on    O
the    O
River    O
Frome    O
to    O
the    O
north    O
of    O
the    O
village    O

The    O
manor    O
was    O
acquired    O
by    O
the    O
Hungerfords    O
of    O
Farleigh    O
Hungerford    O
in    O
the    O
early    O
15th    O
century    O
who    O
used    O
the    O
fulling    B-Fabric103309808
mill    O
to    O
endow    O
their    O
chantry    O

The    O
common    O
name    O
"    O
fuller    O
's    O
ray    O
"    O
comes    O
from    O
an    O
instrument    O
used    O
by    O
fullers    B-Fabric103309808
to    O
smooth    O
cloth    O
,    O
referring    O
to    O
its    O
rough    O
and    O
spiny    O
back    O
.    O

He    O
was    O
born    O
at    O
Toulouse    O
,    O
where    O
his    O
father    O
,    O
surnamed    O
Cujaus    O
,    O
was    O
a    O

Water    O
was    O
an    O
important    O
source    O
of    O
power    O
for    O
industry    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
Etherow    O
and    O
its    O
tributaries    O
were    O
fast    O
flowing    O
and    O
constant    O
.    O
Watermills    O
were    O
used    O
to    O
grind    O
meal    O
and    O
to    O

The    O
presence    O
of    O
Pawtucket    O
Falls    O
offered    O
a    O
source    O
of    O
water    O
power    O
that    O
enabled    O
the    O
construction    O
of    O
a    O
sawmill    O
and    O
gristmill    O
in    O
the    O
early    O
18th    O
century    O
,    O
followed    O
by    O
a    O
fulling    B-Fabric103309808
mill    I-Fabric103309808
in    O
1737    O
.    O

Historically    O
,    O
there    O
was    O
a    O
carding    O
or    O
fulling    B-Fabric103309808
mill    I-Fabric103309808
on    O
the    O
creek    O
.    O

The    O
mill    O
on    O
the    O
Glan    O
’s    O
right    O
bank    O
was    O
built    O
in    O
1542    O
and    O
long    O
served    O
the    O
wool    O
weavers    O
as    O
a    O
walking    B-Fabric103309808
mill    O
.    O

In    O
1477    O
,    O
the    O
regesta    O
mentioned    O
in    O
the    O
Lichtenberg    O
accounts    O
,    O
under    O
palace    O
income    O
,    O
a    O
small    O
fulling    B-Fabric103309808
mill    O
,    O
although    O
its    O
location    O
is    O
now    O
unknown    O
.    O

Once    O
also    O
standing    O
within    O
Pfeffelbach    O
’s    O
limits    O
was    O
a    O

,    O
although    O
its    O
exact    O
site    O
is    O
now    O
unknown    O
.    O

These    O
were    O
all    O
primarily    O
corn    O
mills    O
,    O
but    O
water    O
power    O
was    O
harnessed    O
to    O
many    O
other    O
purposes    O
even    O
in    O
the    O
Middle    O
Ages    O
:    O
in    O
1345    O
we    O
hear    O
of    O
a    O
fulling    B-Fabric103309808

at    O
Water    O
Eaton    O
,    O
as    O
well    O
as    O
the    O
corn    O
mill    O
.    O

Barrowford    O
has    O
been    O
a    O
centre    O
for    O
textile    O
production    O
since    O
at    O
least    O
the    O
16th    O
century    O
when    O
a    O
fulling    B-Fabric103309808
mill    O
is    O
recorded    O
as    O
being    O
in    O
the    O
village    O

By    O
the    O
15th    O
century    O
,    O
fulling    B-Fabric103309808
mills    I-Fabric103309808
had    O
been    O
built    O
along    O
the    O
banks    O
of    O
the    O
River    O
Frome    O
which    O
supported    O
spinning    O
and    O
weaving    O
cottage    O
industries    O
.    O

First    O
used    O
to    O
grind    O
flour    O
as    O
a    O
grist    O
mill    O
,    O
it    O
also    O
functioned    O
as    O
a    O
saw    O
mill    O
and    O
a    O
fulling    B-Fabric103309808

One    O
of    O
the    O
first    O
owners    O
was    O
Andrew    O
Miller    O
.    O

Wigwig    O
once    O
had    O
a    O
mill    O
on    O
the    O
Harley    O
Brook    O
;    O
mentioned    O
as    O
early    O
as    O
1291    O
,    O
it    O
operated    O
variously    O
as    O
a    O
fulling    B-Fabric103309808
mill    I-Fabric103309808
and    O
corn    O
mill    O
but    O
closed    O
during    O
the    O
19th    O
century    O
,    O
although    O
it    O
is    O
still    O
referenced    O
in    O
the    O
name    O
of    O
the    O
Mill    O
Farm    O
nearby    O
.    O

Thomas    O
White    O
soon    O
added    O
a    O
carding    O
and    O
fulling    B-Fabric103309808
mill    I-Fabric103309808

may    O
be    O
finished    O
by    O

Wool    O
processing    O
includes    O

by    O

,    O
classing    O
the    O
wool    O
by    O

untangling    O
,    O
carding    O
and    O
spinning    O
it    O
into    O
yarn    O
,    O
which    O
may    O
be    O
knitted    O
or    O
woven    O
into    O
cloth    O
,    O
then    O
finishing    O
the    O
cloth    O
by    O
fulling    B-Fabric103309808
,    O
napping    B-Fabric103309808

in    O
the    O

,    O
although    O
spinning    O
and    O
weaving    O
continued    O
to    O
be    O
a    O
cottage    O

.    O

The    O
spun    O
fibre    O
would    O
then    O
be    O
woven    O
into    O
cloth    O
,    O
which    O
would    O
be    O
finished    O
by    O

A    O
smaller    O
wheel    O
powered    O
a    O
fulling    B-Fabric103309808
mill    O
,    O
which    O
washed    O
the    O

and    O
kneaded    O
it    O
with    O
