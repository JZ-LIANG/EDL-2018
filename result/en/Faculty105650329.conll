Receptive    B-Faculty105650329

One    O
major    O
goal    O
of    O
sensory    O
neuroscience    O
is    O
to    O
try    O
to    O

;    O
that    O
is    O
,    O
to    O
try    O
to    O
determine    O
which    O
stimuli    O
cause    O
the    O

to    O
fire    O
in    O
what    O
ways    O
.    O

These    O
receptive    B-Faculty105650329
fields    I-Faculty105650329
tend    O
to    O
be    O
larger    O
than    O
those    O
in    O
the    O
striate    O
cortex    O
and    O
often    O
extend    O

For    O
example    O
,    O
the    O
right    O

the    O

the    O
left    O

the    O

the    O

At    O
the    O
start    O
,    O

For    O

the    O
mode    O
of    O
action    O
of    O
capsaicin    O

thought    O

in    O

The    O
cough    O

is    O
initiated    O
by    O
stimulation    O
of    O
two    O
different    O
classes    O

afferent    O
nerves    O
,    O
namely    O
the    O
myelinated    O
rapidly    O

receptors    O
,    O
and    O
nonmyelinated    O

endings    O
in    O
the    O
lungs    O
.    O

However    O
it    O
is    O
not    O
certain    O
that    O
the    O
stimulation    O
of    O
nonmyelinated    O
C-fibers    B-Faculty105650329
leads    O
to    O

(    O
with    O
its    O
own    O
five    O
components    O
)    O
:    O
this    O

Historically    O
,    O
the    O
concept    O
of    O

protector    O
developed    O
in    O
offshore    O
jurisdictions    O
where    O
settlors    O
were    O
(    O
perhaps    O
understandably    O
)    O
concerned    O
about    O
appointing    O
a    O
trust    O
company    O
in    O
a    O
small    O
,    O
distant    O
country    O
as    O
sole    O
trustee    O
of    O
an    O
offshore    B-Faculty105650329
trust    I-Faculty105650329
which    O
is    O
to    O
hold    O
a    O
great    O
deal    O
of    O
the    O
settlor    O
's    O
wealth    O
.    O

Senate    O
investigators    O
allege    O
that    O
the    O
Wyly    O
brothers    O
used    O
the    O
offshore    B-Faculty105650329
trust    I-Faculty105650329
to    O
buy    O
$    O
30    O

worth    O
of    O

,    O
jewelry    O
,    O
furniture    O
and    O
other    O
items    O
for    O
their    O
personal    O
use    O
.    O

There    O
are    O
two    O
likely    O
reasons    O
for    O
this    O
;    O
firstly    O
,    O
for    O
an    O
Offshore    O
Financial    O
Centre    O
,    O
the    O
British    O
Virgin    O
Islands    O
has    O
an    O
underdeveloped    O
banking    O
infrastructure    O
compared    O
to    O
(    O
for    O
example    O
)    O
the    O
Cayman    O
Islands    O
or    O
Jersey    O
and    O
so    O
comparatively    O
modest    O
sums    O
are    O
deposited    O
in    O
the    O
Territory    O
's    O
banks    O
;    O
secondly    O
,    O
the    O
withholding    O
tax    O
only    O
affects    O
deposits    O
held    O
by    O
natural    O
persons    O
-    O
because    O
most    O
offshore    O
tax    O
structuring    O
involves    O
the    O
use    O
of    O
either    O
an    O
offshore    O
company    O
or    O
an    O
offshore    B-Faculty105650329
trust    I-Faculty105650329
,    O
this    O
usually    O
takes    O
it    O
outside    O

scope    O
of    O
