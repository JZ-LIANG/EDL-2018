There    O
are    O
several    O

for    O
this    O
:    O
firstly    O
,    O
sneakernets    O

generally    O
provide    O
very    O
high    O

possibly    O
more    O
importantly    O
,    O
they    O
are    O
"    O
perceived    O
"    O
to    O
be    O
secure    O
)    O
due    O
to    O
the    O
impossibility    O
of    O

or    O
packet    B-Feat100036762

;    O
secondly    O
,    O
the    O
volumes    O
of    O
data    O
concerned    O
are    O
often    O
extremely    O
high    O
;    O
and    O
thirdly    O
,    O
setting    O
up    O
secure    O
network    O
links    O
between    O
the    O

business    O
and    O
the    O

team    O
's    O

is    O
often    O
either    O
impossible    O
or    O
an    O
extremely    O
convoluted    O
process    O
.    O

its    O

Knowledge    O
of    O

these    O

this    O
provides    O

Technically    O
,    O
digest    O
authentication    O
is    O
an    O
application    O
of    O
MD5    O
cryptographic    O
hashing    O
with    O
usage    O
of    O

to    O
prevent    O

attack    I-Feat100036762

So    O
far    O
,    O
however    O
,    O
MD5    O
collision    O
attacks    O
have    O
not    O
been    O

digest    O
authentication    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
RFC    O

allows    O

Therefore    O
,    O
the    O
server    O
may    O
inspect    O
nonce    O
attributes    O

by    O

prevent    O

For    O
subsequent    O
requests    O
,    O
the    O

)    O
must    O
be    O
greater    O
than    O
the    O
last    O

it    O
used    O

otherwise    O
an    O

A    O

weakness    O
