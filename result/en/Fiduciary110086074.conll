It    O
is    O
not    O
surprising    O
that    O
John    O
Cowper    O
Powys    O
should    O
,    O
after    O
he    O
moved    O
to    O

,    O
decide    O
to    O
begin    O
a    O
novel    O
about    O
Owen    O
Glendower    O
,    O
because    O
it    O
was    O
in    O
Corwen    O
that    O
Owen    O
's    O
rebellion    O
against    O

on    O
16    O
September    O
1400    O
,    O
when    O
he    O
formally    O
assumed    O
the    O
ancestral    O
title    O
of    O
Prince    O
of    O

at    O
his    O

it    O
seems    O
that    O
the    O

also    O
led    O
to    O
the    O
widespread    O

Overwhelming    O
(    O

The    O

far    O
back    O

Richard    O

a    O
crusade    O

by    O
himself    O

Dukes    O
of    O

join    O
the    O

.    O

While    O
Philip    O

originally    O

and    O
Louis    O
of    O
Orleans    O
,    O
all    O
three    O
withdrew    O
,    O
claiming    O
that    O
the    O
peace    O
negotiations    O
with    O
England    O
required    O
their    O
presence    O
,    O
though    O
perhaps    O
also    O
because    O
none    O
dared    O
leave    O
the    O
vicinity    O
of    O
the    O
throne    O
if    O
their    O
chief    O
rivals    O
stayed    O

the    O

Edmund    O
Mortimer    O

,    O

On    O
the    O
Royalist    O
side    O
,    O
the    O
campaign    O
of    O
1645    O
opened    O
in    O
the    O
west    O
,    O
where    O
Charles    O
II    O
,    O
the    O
young    O
prince    O
of    O
Wales    O
was    O
sent    O
with    O
Hyde    B-Fiduciary110086074

later    O

advisers    O

After    O
the    O
civil    O
war    O
he    O
refused    O
to    O
return    O
to    O
public    O
life    O
,    O
barely    O
venturing    O
out    O
of    O
his    O
estates    O
;    O
the    O
Earl    B-Fiduciary110086074
of    I-Fiduciary110086074
Clarendon    I-Fiduciary110086074
claimed    O
that    O
he    O
had    O
lived    O
‚Äò    O
as    O
near    O
an    O
innocent    O
life    O
as    O
the    O
iniquity    O
of    O
that    O
time    O
would    O
permit‚Äô.    O
After    O
the    O
English    O
Restoration    O
he    O
represented    O
Cardiganshire    O
in    O
the    O
Cavalier    O
Parliament    O
between    O
1661    O
and    O
1669    O
,    O
and    O
was    O
widely    O
admired    O
for    O
his    O
eloquence    O
,    O
with    O
Samuel    O
Pepys    O
describing    O
him    O
as    O
'    O
the    O
great    O
Vaughan‚Äô.    O
He    O
was    O
knighted    O
and    O
made    O
a    O
serjeant    O
-    O
at    O
-    O
law    O
on    O
20    O
May    O
1668    O
,    O
and    O
made    O
Chief    O
Justice    O
of    O
the    O
Common    O
Pleas    O
on    O
23    O
May.    O
His    O
most    O
enduring    O
case    O
was    O
Bushel    O
's    O
Case    O
in    O
1670    O
,    O
which    O
set    O
the    O
precedent    O
that    O
a    O
jury    O
could    O
not    O
be    O
forced    O
into    O
changing    O
a    O
verdict    O
which    O
a    O
judge    O
does    O
not    O
approve    O
of    O
,    O
one    O
that    O
has    O
endured    O
ever    O
since    O
;    O
as    O
such    O

the    O
jurors    O
involved    O

.    O

The    O
title    O
"    O
Cabal    O
"    O
resulted    O
from    O
the    O
perception    O
that    O
they    O
had    O
conspired    O
together    O
in    O
Clarendon    B-Fiduciary110086074
's    O
fall    O
and    O
prosecution    O
,    O
and    O
in    O
its    O
increasingly    O
secretive    O
conduct    O
of    O
government    O
,    O
and    O
was    O
helped    O
by    O
the    O
fact    O
that    O
the    O
initial    O
letters    O
of    O
their    O
names    O
could    O
be    O
arranged    O
to    O
form    O
