The    O

is    O
also    O
important    O
to    O

this    O

of    O

The    O

is    O
the    O

which    O
according    O
to    O
the    O

(    O

thought    O
to    O

the    O

despised    O
the    O

,    O
and    O
the    O
result    O
was    O
a    O
bitter    O
ideological    O
dispute    O
which    O
was    O
settled    O
only    O
in    O
September    O
1934    O
,    O
when    O
Hitler    O
—    O
who    O
denounced    O
modern    O
art    O
and    O
its    O
practitioners    O
as    O
"    O
incompetents    O
,    O

no    O
place    O

In    O
his    O
role    O
as    O
Chairman    O

he    O
found    O
himself    O

in    O

of    O

of    O

His    O
polemic    O
was    O

of    O
Franklin    O
's    O
themes    O
in    O
writing    O
about    O
Vietnam    O
is    O
that    O
the    O
supposed    O
existence    O
of    O
surviving    O
American    O
prisoners    O
of    O
war    O
in    O
Vietnam    O
after    O
the    O
war    O
was    O
a    O
myth    O
created    O
after    O
1980    O
with    O
the    O
tacit    O
approval    O
of    O
the    O

,    O
and    O
that    O
the    O
psychological    O
foundations    O
of    O
the    O
myth    O
arguably    O
originated    O
from    O
justifications    O
for    O
the    O
war    O
offered    O
by    O
the    O
Nixon    O
before    O
1973    O
,    O
in    O
that    O
the    O
war    O
had    O
to    O
continue    O
in    O
order    O
to    O
