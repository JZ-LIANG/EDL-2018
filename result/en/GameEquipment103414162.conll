A    O
common    O
encoding    O
is    O
to    O
consider    O
0    O
as    O
empty    O

positive    O
as    O
white    O

16    O

The    O
chess    O
pieces    O
begin    O
to    O
move    O
by    O
themselves    O

one    O
of    O
the    O

on    O
the    O

The    O
concept    O
is    O
largely    O
strategic    O
in    O
nature    O
,    O
and    O
involves    O
such    O
concepts    O

weaknesses    O

defensive    O

The    O
pawn    B-GameEquipment103414162
moves    O
like    O
the    O
modern    O
pawn    O
,    O
but    O
can    O
not    O
make    O
an    O
initial    O
double    O
step    O

Byrne    O
captures    O
the    O
queen    O
,    O
but    O
Fischer    O
gets    O
far    O
too    O
much    O
for    O
it    O
–    O
a    O
rook    B-GameEquipment103414162

The    O

for    O

's    O
progression    O
throughout    O
the    O
entire    O

on    O
the    O
board    O
,    O
the    O
pawn    B-GameEquipment103414162

at    O
the    O
end    O
she    O
becomes    O
the    O
strongest    O
,    O
the    O
queen    B-GameEquipment103414162

A    O
pawn    O
storm    O
is    O
a    O

succession    O

John    O

In    O
