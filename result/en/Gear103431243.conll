This    O
has    O
forced    O
the    O
company    O
to    O
implement    O
loadshedding    B-Gear103431243
in    O
specific    O

of    O
the    O
country    O

to    O
reduce    O

initiate    O
an    O

The    O
reason    O
for    O
this    O
belief    O
is    O
that    O
state    O
agencies    O
responsible    O
for    O
providing    O
electricity    O
and    O
ensuring    O

failed    O
so    O
fundamentally    O
so    O
gas    O
lines    O
and    O
rolling    B-Gear103431243
blackouts    I-Gear103431243
fueled    O
widespread    O

at    O
the    O
government    O
.    O

The    O
Federal    O
Energy    O
Regulatory    O
Commission    O
stepped    O
in    O
and    O
set    O
price    O
caps    O
for    O
each    O
megawatt    O
of    O
power    O
bought    O
after    O
lifting    O
the    O
caps    O
to    O
avoid    O
rolling    B-Gear103431243
blackout    I-Gear103431243
six    O
months    O
previously    O
.    O

This    O
leads    O
to    O
frequent    O
and    O
long    O

In    O
the    O
later    O

of    O
2007    O

as    O
