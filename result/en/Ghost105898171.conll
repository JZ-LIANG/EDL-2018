in    O

of    O
her    O
calling    O
as    O
the    O
Mother    O
of    O
God    O
,    O
they    O
do    O
not    O
teach    O
that    O
she    O
was    O
conceived    O
without    O
original    O
sin    O
as    O
their    O
understanding    O
of    O
this    O

differs    O
from    O

and    O
was    O
built    O
in    O
1777    O

to    O

The    O
fundamental    O
elements    O
of    O
their    O
faith    O
are    O
:    O
faith    O
in    O
Jesus    O
as    O
God    O
's    O
son    O
,    O
faith    O
in    O

,    O
forgiveness    O
of    O

.    O

In    O
other    O
words    O
,    O
he    O
believed    O
that    O

be    O

to    O
follow    O
the    O
leading    O
of    O

concerning    O
the    O
length    O
of    O
time    O
in    O
which    O
he    O
is    O
allowed    O
to    O
preach    O
.    O

It    O
dawns    O
on    O
Albert    O
and    O
Lord    O
Seal    O
that    O
these    O
strange    O
people    O
are    O
in    O
fact    O
the    O
Holy    O
Trinity    O
–    O
the    O
perichoresis    O
of    O
God    O

and    O
the    O

in    O

Spirit    I-Ghost105898171
,    O
Christ    O

that    O

their    O
role    O
as    O
God    O
's    O
instruments    O
on    O
earth    O
would    O
not    O

at    O

rebuilt    O
in    O
1869    O

is    O
thought    O
to    O

the    O
only    O
English    O
church    O
dedicated    O
to    O
the    O

During    O
his    O
sermon    O
one    O
day    O
,    O
a    O
child    O
shouted    O
aloud    O
in    O
the    O
church    O
:    O
"    O
Mother    O
,    O

the    O
dove    B-Ghost105898171
resting    O
on    O
the    O
shoulder    O
of    O
Father    O
Didacus    O
!    O
I    O
could    O
preach    O
like    O
that    O
too    O
if    O
a    O
dove    O
told    O
me    O
all    O
that    O
I    O
should    O
say    O
!    O
"    O
Didacus    O
prayed    O
devotedly    O
before    O
his    O
sermons    O
,    O
even    O
scourging    O
himself    O
to    O
the    O
point    O
of    O
blood    O
,    O
in    O
order    O
to    O
draw    O
down    O
God    O
's    O
mercy    O
upon    O
the    O
people    O
.    O

Her    O
argument    O
is    O
that    O
God    O
's    O
aspect    O
of    O
the    O

Various    O
models    O
of    O
resolving    O
the    O
relationship    O
between    O
God    O
the    O
Father    O
and    O
the    O
Son    O
of    O
God    O
were    O
proposed    O
in    O
the    O
2nd    O
century    O
,    O
but    O
later    O
rejected    O
in    O
favor    O
of    O
the    O
doctrine    O
of    O
the    O
Trinity    O
as    O
expounded    O
at    O
the    O
First    O
Council    O
of    O
Constantinople    O
,    O
which    O
confirmed    O
the    O
concept    O
of    O
God    O
as    O
one    O
being    O
consisting    O
of    O
three    O
persons    O
:    O
the    O
Father    O
,    O
the    O
Son    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
Holy    B-Ghost105898171
Spirit    I-Ghost105898171
.    O

It    O
was    O
a    O
foundational    O
doctrinal    O
principle    O
of    O
the    O
Protestant    O
Reformation    O
held    O
by    O
the    O
Reformers    O
,    O
who    O
taught    O
that    O
authentication    O
of    O
Scripture    O
is    O
governed    O
by    O
the    O
discernible    O
excellence    O
of    O
the    O
text    O
as    O
well    O
as    O
the    O
personal    O
witness    O
of    O
the    O
Holy    B-Ghost105898171
Spirit    I-Ghost105898171
to    O
the    O
heart    O
of    O

As    O
Lutherans    O
confess    O
in    O
the    O
Nicene    O
Creed    O
,    O
the    O
Holy    B-Ghost105898171

What    O
is    O
the    O
relationship    O
of    O
justification    O
to    O
sanctification    O
,    O
the    O
process    O
whereby    O
sinners    O

righteous    O

enabled    O

The    O
narrative    O
in    O

at    O

heard    O

they    O
sent    O
Peter    O

John    O
to    O
them    O
,    O
who    O
,    O
when    O
they    O
had    O
come    O
down    O
,    O
prayed    O
for    O
them    O
that    O

Holy    B-Ghost105898171

its    O

the    O

lifted    O

the    O
three    O

According    O

there    O

known    O
as    O
the    O

Although    O
Western    O

often    O
compare    O
this    O
to    O
the    O
familiar    O
spirits    O
of    O
English    O

,    O
it    O
actually    O

more    O
closely    O
with    O
the    O
Japanese    O

and    O
other    O
types    O
of    O

in    O
