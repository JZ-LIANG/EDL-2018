by    O
both    O
classical    O
Roman    O
and    O
Brunelleschi    B-Goldsmith110136615
principles    O
.    O

Masaccio    O
is    O
often    O
compared    O
to    O
contemporaries    O
like    O
Donatello    O
and    O
Brunelleschi    B-Goldsmith110136615
as    O
a    O
pioneer    O
of    O
the    O
renaissance    O

particularly    O
for    O
his    O
use    O
of    O

Ghiberti    O
first    O
became    O
famous    O
when    O
as    O
a    O
23-year    O
-    O
old    O
he    O
won    O
the    O
1401    O
competition    O
for    O
the    O
first    O

of    O

with    O

as    O
the    O
runner    O
up    O

Many    O
artists    O
competed    O
for    O
this    O
commission    O

a    O

selected    O

commissioned    O
by    O
the    O

by    O
his    O

Its    O
meaning    O
for    O
the    O
art    O
of    O
painting    O
can    O
easily    O
be    O
compared    O
to    O
the    O
importance    O
of    O
Brunelleschi    B-Goldsmith110136615
for    O
architecture    O

"    O
(    O
between    O
1410    O
and    O
1425    O
)    O

It    O
was    O
the    O
result    O
of    O
the    O
revival    O
of    O
classic    O
architecture    O
known    O
as    O
Renaissance    O
,    O
but    O
the    O
change    O
had    O
commenced    O
already    O
a    O
century    O
earlier    O
,    O
in    O
the    O
works    O
of    O
Ghiberti    B-Goldsmith110136615
and    O
Donatello    O
in    O
sculpture    O
,    O
and    O
of    O
Brunelleschi    B-Goldsmith110136615
and    O
Alberti    O
in    O
architecture    O
.    O

The    O
painting    O
is    O
one    O
of    O
the    O
earliest    O
known    O
examples    O
of    O
"    O
tabula    O
quadrata    O
et    O
sine    O
civoriis    O
''    O
as    O
suggested    O
by    O
Brunelleschi    B-Goldsmith110136615
,    O
which    O
meant    O
a    O
"    O
modern    O
"    O
type    O
of    O
painting    O
without    O
the    O
inner    O
frames    O
and    O
the    O
gilded    O
background    O
which    O
was    O
typical    O
of    O
earlier    O
painting    O
.    O

Through    O
this    O
work    O
,    O
Giotto    O
has    O
become    O
,    O
together    O
with    O
Brunelleschi    B-Goldsmith110136615
(    O
dome    O
of    O
the    O
cathedral    O
of    O
Florence    O
)    O
and    O
Alberti    O
(    O
with    O
his    O
treatise    O
"    O
De    O
re    O
aedificatoria    O
''    O
,    O
1450    O
)    O
,    O
one    O
of    O
the    O
founding    O
fathers    O
of    O
Italian    O
Renaissance    O
architecture    O
.    O

The    O
structure    O
is    O
inspired    O
to    O
Brunelleschi    B-Goldsmith110136615
's    O
Ospedale    O
degli    O
Innocenti    O
.    O

In    O
1423    O
Bellini    O
was    O
in    O
Florence    O
,    O
where    O
he    O
knew    O
the    O
new    O
works    O
by    O
Brunelleschi    B-Goldsmith110136615
,    O
Donatello    O
,    O
Masolino    O
da    O
Panicale    O
and    O
Masaccio    O
.    O

In    O
Florence    O
he    O
must    O
have    O
met    O
leading    O
masters    O
like    O
Fra    O
Angelico    O
,    O
Luca    O
della    O
Robbia    O
,    O
Donatello    O
and    O
Brunelleschi    B-Goldsmith110136615
.    O

Della    O
Robbia    O
was    O
praised    O
by    O
his    O
compatriot    O
Leon    O
Battista    O
Alberti    O
for    O
genius    O
comparable    O
to    O
that    O
of    O
the    O
sculptors    O
Donatello    O
and    O
Lorenzo    B-Goldsmith110136615
Ghiberti    I-Goldsmith110136615
,    O
the    O
architect    O
Filippo    B-Goldsmith110136615
Brunelleschi    I-Goldsmith110136615
,    O
and    O
the    O
painter    O
Masaccio    O
.    O

He    O
was    O
heavily    O
influenced    O
by    O
Donatello    O
,    O
and    O
in    O
the    O
1420s    O
was    O
used    O
by    O
the    O
architect    O
Filippo    B-Goldsmith110136615
Brunelleschi    I-Goldsmith110136615
for    O
sculpture    O
on    O
his    O
buildings    O
.    O

During    O
the    O
seven    O
years    O
it    O
took    O
della    O
Robbia    O
to    O
carve    O
the    O
reliefs    O
under    O
the    O
supervision    O
of    O
Brunelleschi    B-Goldsmith110136615
,    O
his    O
style    O
developed    O
.    O

Also    O
in    O
1468    O
he    O
contracted    O
to    O
make    O
a    O
golden    O
ball    O
(    O
"    O
palla    O
"    O
)    O
to    O
be    O
placed    O
on    O
top    O
of    O
the    O
lantern    O
of    O
Brunelleschi    B-Goldsmith110136615
's    O
cupola    O
on    O
the    O
Duomo    O
in    O
Florence    O
.    O

Cosimo    O
's    O
patronage    O
enabled    O
the    O
eccentric    O
and    O
bankrupt    O
architect    O
Brunelleschi    B-Goldsmith110136615
to    O
complete    O
the    O
dome    O
of    O

Maria    O
del    O
Fiore    O
(    O
the    O
"    O
Duomo    O
"    O
)    O
which    O
was    O
perhaps    O
his    O
crowning    O
achievement    O
as    O
sponsor    O
.    O

Among    O
the    O
most    O
