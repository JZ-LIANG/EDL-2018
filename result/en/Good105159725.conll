the    O
feasibility    O
of    O

According    O
to    O
Weber    O
,    O
this    O
type    O
of    O
coordination    O
would    O
be    O
inefficient    O
,    O
especially    O
because    O
it    O
would    O
be    O
incapable    O
of    O
solving    O
the    O
problem    O
of    O

(    O

the    O

Inflation    O
became    O
a    O
factor    O
as    O
the    O
prices    O
of    O
consumer    B-Good105159725

went    O
up    O
,    O
while    O
the    O

was    O
deliberately    O
kept    O
lower    O
than    O

Another    O
reason    O
was    O
the    O
changed    O
economic    O
policy    O
under    O
Nikita    O
Khrushchev    O
,    O
which    O
placed    O
more    O
emphasis    O
on    O
producing    O
consumer    B-Good105159725
goods    I-Good105159725
,    O
such    O
as    O
cameras    O
,    O
instead    O
of    O
investment    O
goods    O
and    O
heavy    O
industry    O
.    O

The    O
manufactured    B-Good105159725
goods    I-Good105159725
of    O
the    O
United    O
States    O
became    O
more    O
competitive    O
in    O
the    O
exports    O
market    O
but    O
were    O
still    O
largely    O
unable    O
to    O
succeed    O
in    O
the    O
Japanese    O
domestic    O
market    O
due    O
to    O
Japan    O
's    O
structural    O
restrictions    O
on    O
imports    O
.    O

The    O
Prebisch    O
–    O
Singer    O
hypothesis    O
states    O
that    O
over    O
time    O
the    O
terms    O
of    O
trade    O
for    O
commodities    O
deteriorate    O
compared    O
to    O
those    O
for    O
manufactured    B-Good105159725
goods    I-Good105159725
,    O
because    O
the    O
income    O
elasticity    O
of    O
demand    O
of    O
manufactured    O
goods    O
is    O
greater    O
than    O
that    O
of    O
primary    O
products    O
.    O

However    O
,    O
from    O
1785    O
,    O
imports    O
decreased    O
because    O
of    O
the    O
new    O
iron    O
making    O
technology    O
,    O
and    O
Britain    O
became    O
an    O
exporter    O
of    O
bar    O
iron    O
as    O
well    O
as    O

In    O
2010    O
,    O
an    O
econometrics    O
study    O
by    O
a    O
Rutgers    O
economist    O
found    O
that    O
immigration    O
helped    O
increase    O
bilateral    O
trade    O
when    O
the    O
incoming    O
people    O
were    O
connected    O
via    O
networks    O
to    O
their    O
country    O
of    O
origin    O
,    O
particularly    O
boosting    O
trade    O
of    O
final    B-Good105159725
goods    I-Good105159725
as    O
opposed    O
to    O
intermediate    B-Good105159725
goods    I-Good105159725
,    O
but    O
that    O
the    O
trade    O
benefit    O
weakened    O
when    O
the    O
immigrants    O
became    O
assimilated    O
into    O

culture    O
