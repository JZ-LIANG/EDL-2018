His    O
merit    O
as    O

against    O

Napoleon    B-GrandDuke110142060
had    O
won    O
a    O
decisive    O
victory    O
at    O
the    O
Battle    O
of    O
Austerlitz    O
in    O
1805    O
,    O
and    O
as    O
a    O
consequence    O
Europe    O
remained    O
mostly    O
at    O
peace    O
for    O
the    O
next    O
few    O
years    O
,    O
but    O
tensions    O
continued    O
on    O
the    O
high    O
seas    O
,    O
where    O
the    O
United    O
States    O
had    O
long    O
traded    O
with    O
both    O
France    O
and    O
Britain    O
.    O

The    O
prospects    O
for    O
peace    O
were    O
bolstered    O
by    O
the    O
ascent    O
of    O
Napoleon    B-GrandDuke110142060
November    O
1799    O
,    O
as    O
Napoleon    O
viewed    O
the    O
Quasi    O
-    O
War    O
as    O
a    O
distraction    O
from    O
the    O
ongoing    O
war    O
in    O
Europe    O
.    O

With    O
Dąbrowski    O
he    O
organized    O
the    O
Polish    O
Legions    O
in    O
Italy    O
,    O
serving    O
under    O
Napoleon    B-GrandDuke110142060
Bonaparte    I-GrandDuke110142060
.    O

Lopez    O
also    O
became    O
a    O
great    O
admirer    O
of    O
the    O
French    O
Second    O
Empire    O
and    O
developed    O
a    O
fascination    O
with    O
Napoleon    B-GrandDuke110142060
Bonaparte    I-GrandDuke110142060
.    O

Napoleon    B-GrandDuke110142060
's    O
takeover    O
of    O
Spain    O
in    O
1808    O
and    O
the    O
consequent    O
chaos    O
initiated    O
the    O
dismemberment    O
of    O
the    O
Spanish    O
Empire    O
,    O
as    O
the    O
Hispanic    O
American    O
territories    O
began    O
their    O
struggle    O
for    O
emancipation    O
.    O

Napoleon    B-GrandDuke110142060
would    O
later    O
conceive    O
a    O
similar    O
construction    O
,    O
the    O
Elephant    O
of    O
the    O
Bastille    O

Ross    O
was    O
present    O
at    O
the    O

of    O

which    O
expelled    O
Napoleon    B-GrandDuke110142060

army    O
from    O
Egypt    O
.    O

Another    O
milestone    O
in    O
the    O
Turin    O
university    O
system    O
was    O
the    O
introduction    O
of    O
the    O
new    O
Imperial    O
order    O
,    O
since    O
Piedmont    O
had    O
become    O
a    O
French    O
Department    O
;    O
this    O
involved    O
the    O
personal    O
appointment    O
by    O
Napoleon    B-GrandDuke110142060
of    O
a    O

He    O
left    O
Cairo    O
in    O
August    O
1799    O
on    O
the    O
pretext    O
of    O

the    O
French    O
Marshal    B-GrandDuke110142060
Murat    I-GrandDuke110142060
who    O
was    O
poorly    O
protected    O
,    O
but    O
was    O
nevertheless    O
able    O
to    O
get    O
away    O
from    O
von    O
Lippe    O
who    O
was    O
diverted    O
by    O
a    O
French    O
equerry    O
who    O
himself    O
was    O
killed    O
while    O
Murat    O
fled    O
.    O

Because    O
of    O
his    O
stubborn    O
personality    O
and    O
limited    O
social    O
skills    O
,    O
he    O
developed    O
many    O
enemies    O

This    O
influx    O
of    O

improved    O
the    O

of    O
the    O

the    O
next    O
three    O

to    O
be    O
called    O

,    O
but    O
Napoleon    O
's    O
escape    O
from    O

prevented    O
it    O

Historians    O

an    O

to    O
the    O
tsarevich    O
Alexei    B-GrandDuke110142060

soon    O

and    O
forces    O

to    O

According    O
to    O
the    O
16th    O
century    O
"    O
Lithuanian    O
Chronicle    O
"    O
,    O
they    O
are    O
descendants    O
of    O
Prince    O
Giedrius    O
,    O
a    O
brother    O
of    O
Grand    O
Duke    O
of    O

Traidenis    B-GrandDuke110142060
.    O

He    O
is    O
said    O
by    O
some    O
historians    O
to    O
be    O
descended    O
from    O
the    O
Duke    O
of    O
Kernavė    O
Sirputis    O
,    O
brother    O
of    O
the    O
Grand    O
Duke    O
of    O
Lithuania    O
Traidenis    B-GrandDuke110142060
.    O

After    O
his    O
death    O
most    O
of    O
his    O
lands    O
reverted    O
to    O
Lithuania    O
and    O
came    O
under    O
control    O
of    O
Traidenis    B-GrandDuke110142060
,    O
a    O
noble    O
from    O
Lithuanian    O
Highlands    O
.    O

While    O
some    O
genealogies    O
give    O
Traidenis    B-GrandDuke110142060
as    O
the    O
ancestor    O
,    O
this    O
has    O
been    O
described    O
as    O
unlikely    O
:    O
the    O
later    O
marriage    O
of    O
Gediminas    O
'    O
daughter    O
Eufemija    O
and    O
Traidenis    O
'    O
great    O
-    O
grandson    O
Boleslaw    O
-    O
Yuri    O
would    O
have    O
violated    O
canon    O
law    O
,    O
since    O
the    O
two    O
would    O
have    O
been    O
related    O
by    O
blood    O
,    O
and    O
this    O
violation    O
would    O
likely    O
have    O
been    O
noticed    O
by    O
the    O
pope    O
.    O

As    O
an    O
alliance    O
,    O
the    O
marriage    O
was    O
significant    O
because    O
passages    O
to    O
and    O
from    O
western    O
Europe    O
had    O
to    O
pass    O
through    O
Masovia    O
;    O
it    O
can    O
be    O
seen    O
as    O
an    O
attempt    O
to    O
revive    O
Grand    O
Duke    O

The    O

plan    O
was    O
well    O
under    O
way    O
towards    O
mid    O
morning    O
but    O
a    O
potentially    O
dangerous    O
situation    O
for    O

occurred    O

the    O

both    O
his    O

,    O
in    O

revenge    O
the    O
death    O
of    O
his    O
