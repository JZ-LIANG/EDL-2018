Advances    O
in    O
metallurgy    O
and    O
artillery    O
in    O
the    O
1850s    O
allowed    O
the    O
casting    O
of    O
guns    O
that    O
fired    O
substantially    O
heavier    O

than    O
had    O
previously    O
been    O
in    O

as    O

When    O
the    O
United    O
States    O
became    O
involved    O
in    O
World    O
War    O
I    O
,    O
this    O
was    O
the    O
first    O
artillery    O
unit    O
to    O
be    O
sent    O
to    O
France    O
,    O
and    O
it    O
fired    O
the    O
first    O
US    O
artillery    O

against    O
Germany    O

Horinek    O
called    O
in    O

strikes    O
to    O
suppress    O

fire    O
and    O
allow    O
a    O
landing    O
despite    O
being    O
hit    O
twice    O
more    O
.    O

This    O
rotational    O
molding    O
process    O
was    O
used    O
to    O
create    O
metal    B-Grenade103458271
artillery    I-Grenade103458271
shells    I-Grenade103458271
and    O

The    O
Jagdfaust    O
used    O

shell    B-Grenade103458271
,    O
whose    O
thin    O
walls    O
traded    O
fragmentation    O
for    O
additional    O
explosives    O
;    O
when    O
detonated    O
within    O
an    O
aircraft    O
with    O
sheet    O
metal    O
skin    O
,    O
the    O
skin    O
would    O
be    O
blown    O
off    O
to    O
devastating    O
effect    O
.    O

Because    O
it    O
was    O
intended    O
for    O
short    O
range    O
use    O
,    O
the    O
shell    B-Grenade103458271
had    O
an    O
aerodynamically    O
inefficient    O
shape    O
that    O
could    O
be    O
easily    O
forged    O
or    O
stamped    O
.    O

Increased    O
muzzle    O
velocities    O
with    O
better    O
aerodynamically    O
streamlined    O
projectiles    O
can    O
convey    O
the    O
benefits    O
of    O

,    O
in    O
terms    O
of    O

,    O
increased    O

The    O
ironclad    O
was    O
developed    O
