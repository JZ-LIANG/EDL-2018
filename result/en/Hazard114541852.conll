Meteorologist    O
Ted    O

's    O
research    O

his    O

an    O

1956    O
and    O
a    O

As    O
of    O
1977    O

the    O

Among    O
his    O
first    O
tasks    O
for    O
the    O
UFA    O
was    O
to    O
assist    O

In    O
December    O

;    O
in    O
this    O
capacity    O
,    O
Stewart    O
played    O
a    O
major    O
role    O
in    O
the    O
incorporation    O
of    O
the    O
Alberta    O

Sifton    O
tried    O
to    O
accommodate    O
many    O
of    O
their    O
demands    O
:    O
his    O

Though    O
the    O

The    O

The    O
1945    O

was    O
the    O
most    O
intense    O
tropical    B-Hazard114541852
cyclone    I-Hazard114541852
to    O
strike    O
the    O
U.S.    O

Florida    O
since    O
1935    O

Upon    O
becoming    O
a    O
tropical    B-Hazard114541852
cyclone    I-Hazard114541852
,    O
the    O
storm    O
was    O
located    O
in    O
a    O
favorable    O

,    O
the    O

anticipated    O
the    O
storm    O

reach    O
minimal    O
hurricane    B-Hazard114541852
intensity    O

The    O
surface    O

was    O
able    O
to    O
organize    O
the    O
area    O

,    O
allowing    O
deep    O
convection    O
to    O
occur    O

,    O
the    O
National    O
Hurricane    O

(    O

indicated    O
on    O
August    O

that    O
the    O
system    O
had    O
a    O
90%    O

Accordingly    O

the    O

There    O
was    O
severe    O

on    O

that    O

Minnesota    O
is    O
prone    O
to    O

In    O
late    O
2007    O
an    O
ice    B-Hazard114541852
jam    I-Hazard114541852
formed    O
on    O
the    O
Nechako    O
River    O
and    O
soon    O
grew    O
to    O
a    O
length    O
of    O
more    O
than    O

causing    O
widespread    O
flooding    O
in    O
the    O

.    O

Flash    O
flooding    O
can    O
be    O
caused    O
by    O
extensive    O
rainfall    O
released    O
by    O
tropical    O
cyclones    O
of    O
any    O
strength    O

.    O

At    O
higher    O
speeds    O
opening    O
the    O

would    O
have    O
caused    O
a    O
jump    O
in    O
engine    O
airflow    O
which    O
could    O
have    O
unstart    B-Hazard114541852
the    O

.    O

If    O
that    O
were    O
to    O
happen    O
,    O
the    O
engine    O
may    O
unstart    B-Hazard114541852

resulting    O
in    O

Initially    O

A    O

The    O

maintained    O

a    O

Due    O

was    O
conducive    O

Later    O
that    O

,    O
the    O

The    O
storm    O
became    O
disorganized    O
while    O

The    O

However    O
,    O
vertical    O
wind    B-Hazard114541852

leads    O
to    O

Vertical    O
wind    B-Hazard114541852

forces    O
the    O
rainfall    O

around    O
a    O
tropical    O
cyclone    O
to    O
become    O

Using    O
this    O

to    O
work    O

One    O
proposal    O
is    O
that    O

a    O
part    O
of    O

,    O
specifically    O
related    O
to    O

(    O
ENSO    O
)    O
.    O

It    O
proposed    O
this    O
could    O
be    O
due    O
to    O
changes    O
in    O
atmospheric    O
and    O
ocean    O
circulation    O
around    O

was    O
the    O

,    O
which    O
brought    O
heavy    O
rain    O
for    O
many    O
weeks    O
,    O
causing    O
roots    O
to    O
