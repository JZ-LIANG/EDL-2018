made    O
an    O

to    O

His    O

agreed    O

his    O
patron    O
,    O
King    O
Henry    O
I.    O
Judith    O
Green    O
believes    O
that    O
Henry    O
I    O
's    O
generosity    O
had    O
two    O
causes    O
;    O
firstly    O
,    O
his    O
wife    O
—    O
David    O
's    O
sister    O
Matilda    O
—    O
was    O
pressuring    O
her    O
husband    O
to    O
bestow    O
favour    O
on    O
her    O
younger    O
brother    O
;    O
secondly    O
,    O
Henry    O
wished    O
to    O
secure    O
support    O
for    O
his    O
succession    O
plans    O
.    O

How    O
long    O
it    O
took    O
to    O
pacify    O
Moray    O
is    O
not    O
known    O
,    O
but    O
in    O
this    O
period    O
it    O
is    O
now    O
thought    O
that    O
David    O
appointed    O
his    O
nephew    O
William    O
fitz    O
Duncan    O
to    O
succeed    O
Óengus    O
,    O
perhaps    O
in    O
compensation    O
for    O
the    O
exclusion    O
from    O
the    O
succession    O
to    O
the    O
Scottish    O
throne    O
caused    O
by    O
the    O
coming    O
of    O
age    O
of    O
David    O
's    O
son    O
Henry    B-Heir110168584
