were    O
pulling    O

with    O
an    O
improved    O
harness    O
design    O
that    O
made    O
use    O
of    O
a    O
breastcollar    O
and    O
breeching    O
,    O
which    O
allowed    O
a    O
horse    O
to    O
move    O
faster    O

more    O
weight    O

The    O
Hyksos    B-Hieroglyph106403679

brought    O
the    O

to    O
Ancient    O
Egypt    O
in    O
the    O
16th    O
century    O
BC    O

the    O
Egyptians    O
adopted    O
its    O
use    O
from    O

The    O
major    O
advance    O
in    O

began    O
around    O

the    O

fought    O

who    O
had    O
made    O
themselves    O
lords    O
of    O

By    O
the    O
later    O

period    O
,    O
the    O
navy    O
was    O
highly    O

complicated    O

the    O

in    O
Egyptian    O
art    O
as    O
a    O
dog    O

jackal    O
,    O
a    O
creature    O
whose    O
scavenging    O
habits    O
threaten    O
the    O
preservation    O
of    O
buried    O
mummies    O
,    O
in    O
an    O
effort    O
to    O
counter    O
this    O
threat    O

it    O

are    O

In    O

,    O
Queens    O
like    O

Misfortune    O
was    O
often    O

as    O
a    O
product    O
of    O

the    O

was    O
the    O
opposite    O
of    O

therefore    O
the    O

this    O

from    O
long    O

The    O

story    O
can    O
not    O
be    O
definitively    O
related    O

it    O

widely    O

that    O
the    O
patriarchal    O
age    O
,    O
along    O
with    O
the    O
exodus    B-Hieroglyph106403679
and    O
the    O
period    O
of    O
the    O
judges    O
,    O
is    O
a    O
late    O
literary    O
construct    O
that    O
does    O
not    O
relate    O
to    O
any    O
period    O
in    O
actual    O
history    O
.    O

A    O
common    O
hypothesis    O
among    O
scholars    O
is    O
that    O
it    O
was    O
composed    O
in    O
the    O
early    O
Persian    O
period    O
(    O
late    O
6th    O
century    O
BCE    O
)    O
as    O
a    O
result    O
of    O
tensions    O
between    O
Jewish    O
landowners    O
who    O
had    O
stayed    O
in    O
Judah    O
during    O
the    O
Babylonian    O
captivity    O
and    O
traced    O
their    O
right    O
to    O
the    O
land    O
through    O
their    O
"    O
father    O
Abraham    O
"    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
returning    O
exiles    O
who    O
based    O
their    O
counter    O
-    O
claim    O
on    O
Moses    O
and    O
the    B-Hieroglyph106403679
