Thus    O
,    O
Muslims    O
have    O
traditionally    O
had    O
no    O
problem    O
accepting    O
those    O
other    O
Hebrew    O
prophets    O
not    O
mentioned    O
in    O
the    O
Quran    O

as    O
legitimate    O
prophets    O
of    O
God    O
,    O
especially    O
as    O
the    O
Quran    O
itself    O
states    O
:    O
"    O
Surely    O
We    O
sent    O
down    O
the    O
Torah    O
(    O
to    O
Moses    O
)    O
,    O
wherein    O
is    O
guidance    O
and    O
light    O
;    O
thereby    O
the    O
Prophets    O
(    O
who    O
followed    O
him    O
)    O
,    O
who    O
had    O
surrendered    O
themselves    O
,    O
gave    O
judgment    O
for    O
those    O
who    O
were    O
Jewish    O
,    O
as    O
did    O
the    O
masters    O
and    O
the    O
rabbis    O
,    O
following    O
such    O
portion    O
of    O
God    O
's    O
Book    O
as    O
they    O
were    O
given    O
to    O
keep    O
and    O
were    O
witnesses    O
to    O
,    O
"    O
with    O
this    O
passage    O
having    O
often    O
been    O
interpreted    O
by    O
Muslims    O
to    O
include    O
within    O
the    O
phrase    O
"    O

an    O

There    O
is    O

a    O

Ezra    B-HighPriest110175248

As    O
his    O

from    O

with    O
a    O
large    O
army    O
,    O
in    O
order    O
to    O
install    O
Alcimus    B-HighPriest110175248
with    O
the    O
office    O
of    O
high    O
priest    O
.    O

Following    O
the    O
death    O
of    O
his    O
puppet    O
governor    O
Alcimus    B-HighPriest110175248
,    O
High    O
Priest    O
of    O
Jerusalem    O
,    O
Bacchides    O
felt    O
secure    O
enough    O
to    O
leave    O
the    O
country    O
,    O
but    O
two    O
years    O
after    O
the    O
departure    O
of    O
Bacchides    O
from    O
Israel    O
,    O
the    O
City    O
of    O
Acre    O
felt    O
sufficiently    O
threatened    O
by    O
Maccabee    O
incursions    O
to    O
contact    O
Demetrius    O
and    O
request    O
the    O
return    O
of    O
Bacchides    O
to    O
their    O
territory    O
.    O

He    O
had    O
reason    O
to    O
hope    O
that    O
the    O
victory    O
of    O
the    O
national    O
party    O
under    O
Judas    B-HighPriest110175248
Maccabeus    I-HighPriest110175248
would    O
place    O
him    O
in    O
the    O
office    O
of    O
his    O
fathers    O
;    O
but    O
being    O
disappointed    O
in    O
his    O
expectations    O
by    O
the    O
election    O
of    O
Alcimus    B-HighPriest110175248
,    O
he    O
went    O
to    O
Egypt    O
to    O
seek    O
aid    O
against    O
the    O
tyranny    O
of    O
the    O
Seleucids    O
at    O
the    O
court    O
of    O
the    O
Ptolemies    O
,    O
their    O
political    O
enemies    O
.    O

Ptah-Du-Auu    B-HighPriest110175248
was    O
a    O
nobleman    O
and    O
priest    O
in    O
ancient    O
Egypt    O
,    O
who    O
lived    O
during    O
the    O
4th    O
dynasty    O
.    O

Khuwyptah    O
was    O
the    O
son    O
of    O
Kanefer    B-HighPriest110175248
and    O
Tjentety    O
.    O

The    O
descendants    O
of    O
Zadok    O
increased    O
in    O
rank    O
and    O
influence    O
,    O
so    O
that    O
his    O
son    O
Azariah    O
was    O
one    O
of    O
the    O
princes    O
of    O
Solomon,(1    O
Kings    O
4:2    O
)    O
and    O
the    O
Ahimaaz    B-HighPriest110175248
who    O
married    O
a    O
daughter    O
of    O
Solomon    O
was    O
probably    O
another    O
of    O
Zadok    O
's    O
sons    O
(    O

Either    O
Zadok    O
himself    O

his    O
grandson    O
was    O
the    O
ruler    O
of    O
the    O
Aaronite    O
priests    O
(    O

Jerusha    O
,    O
the    O
mother    O
of    O
Jotham    O
,    O
is    O
apparently    O
termed    O
the    O
daughter    O
of    O
Zadok    O
to    O
emphasize    O
her    O
noble    O
lineage    O
,    O
since    O
her    O
father    O
may    O
have    O
been    O
a    O
descendant    O
of    O
the    O
first    O
Zadok    O
(    O
