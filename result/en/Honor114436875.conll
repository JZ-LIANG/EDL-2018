a    O

he    O
played    O
for    O
The    O
Zulus    O
a    O
touring    O
side    O
created    O
to    O

of    O
the    O
Zulu    B-Honor114436875
War    I-Honor114436875
.    O

In    O
the    O
run    O
-    O
up    O
to    O
the    O
Zulu    B-Honor114436875
War    I-Honor114436875
,    O
he    O
was    O
served    O
with    O
an    O
ultimatum    O
by    O
the    O
British    O
at    O
the    O
same    O
time    O
as    O
Cetshwayo    O

Though    O
Mpande    O
and    O
Cetshwayo    O
had    O
successfully    O
resisted    O
attempts    O
by    O
the    O
Boers    O

the    O

to    O

the    O
Anglo-Zulu    B-Honor114436875
War    I-Honor114436875
of    O
1879    O
forced    O
John    O
Dunn    O
to    O
pick    O
sides    O
,    O
and    O
he    O
sided    O
with    O
the    O
British    O
.    O

So    O
began    O
the    O
Anglo-Zulu    B-Honor114436875
War    I-Honor114436875
.    O

The    O
imposition    O
of    O
a    O
federation    O
upon    O
Southern    O
Africa    O
was    O
,    O
however    O
,    O
doomed    O
to    O
failure    O
and    O
led    O
to    O
resentment    O
across    O
the    O
region    O
(    O
culminating    O
disastrously    O
in    O
the    O
Anglo-Zulu    B-Honor114436875
War    I-Honor114436875
,    O
the    O
First    O
Boer    O
War    O
and    O
other    O
conflicts    O

.    O

Cetshwayo    O
was    O
unable    O
to    O
comply    O
with    O
Frere    O
's    O
ultimatum    O
-    O
even    O
if    O
he    O
had    O
wanted    O
to    O
;    O
Frere    O
ordered    O
Lord    O
Chelmsford    O
to    O
invade    O
Zululand    O
,    O
and    O
so    O
the    O
