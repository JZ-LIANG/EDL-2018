was    O
a    O
legion    B-Host108183802
of    O
the    O
Imperial    O
Roman    O
army    O
.    O

The    O
legion    O
was    O
created    O
by    O
Emperor    O
Vespasian    O
in    O

from    O
the    O

of    O
the    O

which    O
had    O
surrendered    O
in    O
the    O
Batavian    O
rebellion    O
)    O
,    O
and    O
still    O
existed    O
in    O
the    O
4th    O
century    O
,    O
when    O
it    O
guarded    O
the    O

and    O
camped    O
in    O
Sura    O

Because    O

probably    O

in    O
the    O

Anthony    O

suggests    O
that    O
Cerialis    O
was    O
the    O
younger    O

of    O

had    O

His    O

For    O
the    O

to    O
around    O

The    O
Roman    O
arrival    O
in    O

it    O

the    O

he    O
himself    O
remained    O

though    O
he    O
may    O
have    O
been    O

,    O
however    O
,    O

Among    O
European    O
countries    O
,    O
the    O
golden    O
eagle    O
was    O
the    O
model    O
for    O
the    O

,    O

the    O

and    O
more    O
generally    O
the    O
Roman    O
civilization    O
that    O
had    O
such    O
a    O
powerful    O
impact    O
on    O
Western    O
culture    O
;    O
furthermore    O
,    O
some    O
classical    O
Roman    O
traditions    O
were    O
carried    O
on    O
by    O
the    O
Eastern    O
Roman    O
Empire    O
in    O
the    O
Southern    O
and    O
Eastern    O
of    O

the    O
Holy    O
Roman    O
Empire    O
in    O
Central    O
and    O
Western    O
Europe    O
,    O
transmitting    O
the    O
use    O

the    O

to    O
several    O

Beer    O
was    O
apparently    O
enjoyed    O
by    O
some    O

.    O

When    O
Octavius    O
took    O
control    O
of    O
Britain    O
from    O
Rome    O
,    O
Constantine    O
sent    O
three    O

to    O
Britain    O
under    O

His    O
claim    O
to    O
the    O
throne    O
was    O
quickly    O
challenged    O
by    O
legions    B-Host108183802
stationed    O
in    O
the    O
Eastern    O
provinces    O

declared    O
their    O
commander    O
Vespasian    O
emperor    O
in    O
his    O
place    O
.    O

He    O
fortified    O
the    O
coast    O
facing    O
Ireland    O
,    O
and    O
Tacitus    O
recalls    O
that    O
his    O
father    O
-    O
in    O
-    O
law    O
often    O
claimed    O
the    O
island    O
could    O
be    O
conquered    O
with    O
a    O
single    O
legion    B-Host108183802
and    O
a    O
few    O
auxiliaries    O

however    O
organised    O

Further    O
,    O
the    O

three    O

The    O
internal    O

According    O
to    O

then    O

in    O
the    O

reduced    O
the    O

demolished    O
a    O

The    O

Around    O
