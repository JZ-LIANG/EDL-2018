,    O

Under    O
the    O
Kurgan    O
hypothesis    O
,    O
there    O
are    O
two    O
possibilities    O
for    O
how    O
the    O
early    O
Anatolian    O
speakers    O
could    O
have    O
reached    O
Anatolia    O
:    O
from    O
the    O
north    O
via    O
the    O
Caucasus    B-HotSpot108586330
,    O
and    O
from    O
the    O
west    O
,    O
via    O
the    O
Balkans    O
,    O
the    O
latter    O
of    O
which    O
is    O
considered    O
somewhat    O
more    O
likely    O
by    O
Mallory    O
(    O
1989    O
)    O
,    O
Steiner    O
(    O

and    O

According    O
to    O

94%    O

3%    O

3%    O
from    O

.    O

Another    O
possibility    O
is    O
that    O

of    O

are    O
postulated    O
to    O
occur    O
as    O

Although    O
it    O
is    O
now    O
well    O
accepted    O
that    O
subducting    O
slabs    O
cross    O
the    O

transition    O
zone    O
and    O
descend    O

about    O
the    O
existence    O
and    O
continuity    O
of    O

with    O
important    O
implications    O
for    O
the    O
style    O

.    O

This    O
debate    O
is    O
linked    O
to    O
the    O
controversy    O
regarding    O
whether    O
intraplate    O
volcanism    O
is    O
caused    O
by    O
shallow    O
,    O
upper    O

mantle    O
processes    O
or    O
by    O
plumes    B-HotSpot108586330
from    O
the    O
lower    O
mantle    O
.    O

One    O
suggests    O
that    O
hotspots    O
are    O
due    O
to    O
mantle    B-HotSpot108586330
plume    I-HotSpot108586330
that    O
rise    O
as    O
thermal    O
diapirs    O
from    O
the    O
core    O
–    O
mantle    O
boundary    O
.    O

It    O
was    O
later    O
postulated    O
that    O
hotspots    O
are    O
fed    O
by    O
narrow    O
streams    O
of    O
hot    O
mantle    O
rising    O
from    O
the    O
Earth    O
's    O
core    O

mantle    O
boundary    O
in    O

called    O
a    O
mantle    B-HotSpot108586330
plume    I-HotSpot108586330
.    O

The    O
hotspot    O
hypothesis    O
is    O
now    O
closely    O
linked    O
to    O
