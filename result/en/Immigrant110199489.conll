The    O
history    O
of    O
General    O
Six    O
-    O
Principle    O
Baptists    O
in    O
America    O
began    O
in    O
Rhode    O
Island    O
in    O
1652    O
when    O
the    O
historic    O
First    O

Church    O
,    O
once    O
associated    O
with    O
Roger    B-Immigrant110199489
Williams,    I-Immigrant110199489
split    O
,    O
The    O
occasion    O
was    O
the    O
development    O
within    O
the    O
congregation    O
of    O
an    O
Arminian    O
majority    O
who    O
held    O
to    O
the    O
six    O
principles    O
of    O
Hebrew    O
6:1–2    O
:    O
repentance    O
from    O
dead    O
works    O
,    O
faith    O
toward    O
God    O
,    O
the    O
doctrine    O
of    O
baptisms    O
,    O
the    O
laying    O
-    O
on    O
of    O
hands    O
,    O
resurrection    O
of    O
the    O
dead    O
,    O
and    O
eternal    O
judgment    O
.    O

For    O
example    O
,    O
John    O
Milton    O
gave    O
Roger    B-Immigrant110199489
Williams    I-Immigrant110199489
an    O
opportunity    O
to    O

Hebrew    O
,    O
Greek    O
,    O
Latin    O
,    O
and    O
French    O
,    O
while    O
receiving    O
lessons    O
in    O
Dutch    O
in    O
exchange    O
.    O

The    O
following    O
month    O
,    O
Captain    O
Pierce    O
reported    O
that    O
the    O
ship    O
was    O
fully    O
laden    O
with    O
supplies    O
,    O
and    O
it    O
set    O
sail    O
in    O
December    O
with    O
mostly    O
cargo    O
,    O
but    O
also    O
20    O

Roger    B-Immigrant110199489

the    O
encouragement    O
of    O
Roger    B-Immigrant110199489
Williams    I-Immigrant110199489
,    O
they    O
bought    O
land    O
of    O
the    O
Indians    O
and    O
settled    O
on    O
the    O
island    O
of    O
Aquidneck    O
in    O
the    O
Narragansett    O

naming    O
the    O
settlement    O

later    O
changed    O
the    O
