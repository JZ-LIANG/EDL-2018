fed    O
his    O

by    O

,    O
Escrivá    O
was    O
able    O
to    O
return    O
to    O
Madrid    O
.    O

During    O
the    O
Spanish    O
Civil    O
War    O
,    O
Escrivá    O
fled    O
from    O
Madrid    O
,    O
which    O
was    O
controlled    O
by    O
the    O
republicans    O
,    O
via    O
Andorra    O

France    O

Francisco    B-Imp110200047

.    O

Critics    O
have    O
alleged    O
that    O
Escrivá    O
personally    O
,    O
as    O
well    O
as    O
the    O
organization    O
of    O
Opus    O
Dei    O
,    O
were    O
associated    O
originally    O
with    O
the    O
ideology    O
of    O
"    O
National    O
Catholicism    O
"    O
,    O
particularly    O
during    O
the    O
Spanish    O
Civil    O
War    O
and    O
during    O
the    O
years    O
immediately    O
after    O
it    O
,    O
and    O
that    O
they    O
were    O
therefore    O
also    O
closely    O
associated    O
with    O
the    O
authoritarian    O
regime    O
of    O
General    B-Imp110200047
Franco    I-Imp110200047
.    O

These    O
sources    O
of    O
criticism    O

his    O

private    O
statements    O
in    O
defense    O
of    O
Adolf    O

members    O
of    O

right    O

causes    O
(    O

's    O
request    O
for    O
the    O
rehabilitation    O
in    O
his    O
favor    O
of    O
an    O
aristocratic    O
title    O

and    O
allegations    O
that    O
he    O
maintained    O
bad    O
relations    O
with    O
other    O
Catholic    O
officials    O

of    O
whom    O
he    O
could    O
be    O
very    O
critical    O
in    O
private    O
.    O

One    O
of    O
the    O
most    O
controversial    O
accusations    O
against    O
Escrivá    O
is    O
that    O
he    O
and    O
Opus    O
Dei    O
were    O
active    O
in    O
bolstering    O
far    O

regimes    O

at    O

Göring    O
to    O
continue    O
his    O
private    O

,    O
mainly    O
because    O
of    O

's    O

,    O
the    O
resistance    O
movement    O
was    O
based    O
on    O
civic    O
associations    O
.    O

In    O
1966    O
he    O
was    O
arrested    O
at    O
a    O
clandestine    O
assembly    O
at    O
the    O
University    O
of    O
Barcelona    O
;    O
his    O
work    O
of    O
the    O
early    O
1970s    O
is    O
marked    O
by    O
symbols    O
of    O
Catalan    O
identity    O
(    O
which    O
was    O
anathema    O
to    O

Memorial    O
Dinner    O
in    O
Whitehall    O
,    O
commemorating    O
the    O
anniversary    O
of    O
his    O
death    O
.    O

In    O
1952    O
,    O
Carlos    O
Hugo    O
's    O
father    O
publicly    O
laid    O
claim    O
to    O
the    O
Spanish    O
throne    O
as    O
Javier    O
I    O
,    O
but    O
he    O
was    O
ignored    O
by    O
Spanish    O
dictator    O
Francisco    B-Imp110200047
Franco    I-Imp110200047
,    O
who    O
later    O
chose    O
Juan    O
Carlos    O
to    O
be    O
his    O
successor    O
instead    O
.    O

His    O
doctoral    O
thesis    O
was    O
rejected    O
by    O
the    O
university    O
,    O
however    O
,    O
and    O
handed    O
over    O
to    O
the    O
police    O
,    O
due    O
to    O
his    O
inclusion    O
of    O
a    O
number    O
of    O
lines    O
critical    O
of    O
the    O
rule    O
of    O
Franco    B-Imp110200047

Despite    O
his    O
role    O
in    O
the    O
Di    O
Stéfano    O
affair    O
,    O
twice    O
defecting    O

and    O
his    O
friendship    O
with    O
Franco    B-Imp110200047
,    O
he    O
remained    O
a    O
legendary    O
figure    O
at    O
FC    O
Barcelona    O
and    O
when    O
he    O
died    O
in    O
1972    O
he    O
was    O
given    O
a    O
virtual    O
state    O
funeral    O
by    O
the    O
club    O
.    O

It    O
has    O
been    O
suggested    O
that    O
Samitier    O
used    O
his    O
connections    O
within    O
the    O
Franco    B-Imp110200047
regime    O
to    O
help    O
arrange    O
the    O
transfer    O
.    O

While    O
in    O
Morocco    O
,    O
he    O
joined    O

He    O
later    O
regretted    O

the    O

saying    O
that    O
the    O

that    O
the    O
incident    O
was    O

Chilean    O
delegation    O

have    O
established    O
a    O
positive    O

it    O
is    O
very    O
unlikely    O
any    O
