abolished    O

In    O
the    O
early    O
colonial    O
period    O
,    O
the    O
Spanish    O

up    O

to    O

but    O
the    O
rough    O
terrain    O
and    O
lack    O
of    O
mineral    O
wealth    O
kept    O
the    O
Spanish    O
from    O
imposing    O
serious    O
control    O
.    O

As    O
a    O
result    O
of    O
the    O
"    O
New    O
laws    O
"    O
of    O
1548    O
and    O
the    O
influence    O
of    O
the    O
denunciation    O
of    O
the    O
abuses    O
against    O
Native    O
Americans    O
by    O
Friar    O
Bartolomé    O
de    O

slaves    O
gradually    O
replaced    O
natives    O
at    O
the    O
encomienda    B-Indie108249854
.    O

After    O
the    O
Spanish    O
conquest    O
in    O
1521    O
,    O
Hernán    O
Cortés    O
took    O
Huaxtepec    O
for    O
himself    O
in    O
encomienda    B-Indie108249854
,    O
along    O
with    O
the    O
Amilpas    O
communities    O

it    O
,    O
including    O

,    O
a    O
despotic    O
encomendero    B-Indie108249854

Juancho    O
was    O
trained    O
by    O
his    O
father    O
to    O
be    O
a    O
despotic    O
encomendero    B-Indie108249854
like    O
him    O
.    O

He    O
was    O
given    O
a    O
large    O
salary    O
and    O
had    O
permission    O
to    O
use    O
as    O
many    O
Indians    O
as    O
he    O
wanted    O
under    O
the    O
encomienda    B-Indie108249854
system    O
.    O

He    O
allowed    O
the    O
Native    O
Americans    O
of    O
Pecos    O
to    O
practice    O
their    O
religion    O
as    O
long    O
as    O
they    O
paid    O
double    O
the    O
price    O
of    O
the    O
required    O
encomienda    B-Indie108249854
's    O
tribute    O
,    O
contributing    O
to    O
his    O
personal    O
enrichment    O
.    O

The    O
first    O
encomendero    B-Indie108249854
was    O
established    O
in    O
1525    O
at    O
Cacahuatepec    O
,    O
which    O
is    O
part    O
of    O
the    O
modern    O
Acapulco    O
municipality    O
.    O

Several    O
other    O
soldiers    O
were    O
participating    O
in    O
the    O
journey    O
,    O
who    O
would    O
later    O
become    O
encomenderos    B-Indie108249854
and    O
take    O
part    O
in    O
the    O
conquest    O
of    O
other    O
parts    O
of    O
Colombia    O
.    O

From    O
the    O
beginnings    O
of    O
the    O
14th    O
century    O
onwards    O
Ademuz    O
and    O
its    O
countryside    O
were    O
also    O
as    O
an    O
Encomienda    B-Indie108249854
of    O
the    O
Order    O
of    O
Montesa    O
,    O
which    O
anyway    O
never    O
ruled    O
over    O
Ademuz    O
,    O
limiting    O
itself    O
to    O
collect    O
some    O
taxes    O
they    O
had    O
rights    O
over    O
.    O

In    O
1538    O

finally    O
erected    O
the    O

.    O

The    O
encomienda    B-Indie108249854
system    O
was    O
established    O
in    O
the    O
region    O
between    O
1525    O
and    O
1530    O
AD    O
,    O
and    O
missionaries    O
began    O
their    O
efforts    O
to    O
convert    O
the    O
Mixtec    O
in    O
1538    O
AD    O
.    O

This    O
bill    O
was    O
based    O
on    O
the    O
arguments    O
given    O
by    O
the    O
best    O
Spanish    O
theologists    O
and    O
jurists    O
who    O
were    O
unanimous    O
in    O
the    O
condemnation    O
of    O
such    O
slavery    O
as    O
unjust    O
;    O
they    O
declared    O
it    O
illegitimate    O
and    O
outlawed    O
it    O
from    O
America    O
—    O
not    O
just    O
the    O
slavery    O
of    O
Spaniards    O
over    O
Indians    O
—    O
but    O
also    O
the    O
type    O
of    O
slavery    O
practiced    O
among    O
the    O
Indians    O
themselves    O
The    O
labor    O
system    O
of    O
Encomienda    B-Indie108249854
was    O
also    O
abolished    O
in    O
1550    O
.    O

Aporo    O
then    O
became    O

of    O
an    O

The    O
aim    O
of    O
this    O
expedition    O
was    O
to    O
weaken    O
the    O
power    O
