The    O
techniques    O
can    O
be    O
divided    O
into    O
two    O
main    O
categories    O
:    O
resistance    O
sintering    O
,    O
which    O
incorporates    O
spark    O
plasma    O
sintering    O
and    O
hot    O

;    O
and    O

Hot    O
forging    O
prevents    O
the    O
work    B-IndustrialProcess113497928
hardening    I-IndustrialProcess113497928
that    O
would    O
result    O
from    O
cold    O
forging    O
,    O
which    O
would    O
increase    O
the    O
difficulty    O
of    O
performing    O
secondary    O
machining    O
operations    O
on    O
the    O
piece    O
.    O

The    O
main    O
advantage    O
of    O
hot    O
forging    O
is    O
that    O
it    O
can    O
be    O
done    O
more    O
quickly    O

of    O

the    O
