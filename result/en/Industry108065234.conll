This    O
led    O
to    O
fears    O
that    O
the    O
sale    O
of    O
the    O
platinum    O
coins    O
would    O
decrease    O
,    O
as    O
the    O
automotive    B-Industry108065234
industry    I-Industry108065234
was    O
responsible    O
for    O
approximately    O
a    O
third    O
of    O
platinum    O
consumption    O
.    O

This    O
technology    O
was    O
credited    O
with    O
integrating    O
the    O
engineering    O
design    O
function    O
with    O
the    O
numerically    O

industries    O
,    O
dramatically    O
improving    O
cost    O
and    O
manufacture    O
time    O
.    O

The    O
idea    O
for    O
JPMA    O
was    O
born    O
in    O
1959    O
when    O
a    O
group    O
of    O
juvenile    O
products    O
manufacturers    O
came    O
together    O
as    O
the    O
voice    O
of    O
the    O
industry    O
when    O
the    O
United    O
States    O
government    O
imposed    O
an    O
automotive    B-Industry108065234
tax    O
that    O
applied    O
to    O
car    O
seats    O
.    O
