General    O

ameliorating    O
the    O

conditions    O
of    O
workers    O
,    O
the    O
importance    O
of    O
the    O
commission    O
was    O
due    O
to    O
the    O
rise    O
in    O
cost    O
of    O
living    O
as    O
a    O
result    O

,    O
and    O
the    O
human    O
condition    O
—    O
as    O
exemplified    O
in    O
friendship    O
between    O
the    O
Yoruba    O

the    O
Igbo    O
and    O
in    O
relationships    O
between    O
children    O

parents    O
.    O

However    O
,    O
as    O
the    O
Nigerian    O
political    O
scene    O
became    O
more    O
volatile    O
with    O
the    O

,    O
politicians    O
came    O
to    O

The    O

would    O
later    O
be    O
