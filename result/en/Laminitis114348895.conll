been    O
called    O

an    O
offense    O
to    O

religion    O
,    O
and    O
demanded    O
that    O

all    O
references    O
to    O

from    O
the    O
trailer    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
film    O
itself    O

It    O

in    O
particular    O
one    O
gopi    O
named    O
Radha    O

It    O
is    O
mentioned    O
that    O
Radha    O
is    O
greater    O
than    O
Krishna    B-Laminitis114348895
.    O

He    O
is    O
most    O
known    O
for    O
his    O
epic    O
poem    O
"    O

"    O
which    O
concentrates    O
on    O
Krishna    B-Laminitis114348895

According    O
to    O
the    O
epic    O
Mahābhārata    O
,    O
Bareilly    O
region    O
(    O
Panchala    O

said    O
to    O
be    O
the    O
birthplace    O
of    O
Draupadi    O
,    O
who    O
was    O
also    O
referred    O
to    O
as    O
'    O
Panchali    O
'    O
(    O
one    O
from    O
the    O
kingdom    O
of    O

)    O
by    O
Kṛṣṇā    O
(    O

.    O

Legend    O
has    O
it    O
that    O
the    O
idol    O
of    O
Lord    O
Vishnu    O
consecrated    O
here    O
is    O
the    O
very    O
idol    O
worshiped    O
by    O
Sathyabhama    O
,    O
the    O
consort    O
of    O
Lord    B-Laminitis114348895
Krishna    I-Laminitis114348895
,    O
at    O
Dwaraka    O
in    O
the    O
Mahabharata    O
Era    O
more    O
than    O
5,000    O
years    O
ago    O
.    O

They    O
play    O
a    O
significant    O
role    O
in    O
a    O
number    O
of    O
Hindu    O
spiritual    O
traditions    O
,    O
especially    O
those    O
associated    O
with    O
the    O
worship    O
of    O
Vishnu    O
and    O
his    O
avatar    O
Krishna    B-Laminitis114348895
,    O
sometimes    O
even    O
in    O
traditions    O
related    O
to    O
the    O
god    O
Shiva    O
.    O

So    O
it    O
is    O
paramount    O
that    O
one    O
surrenders    O
to    O
God    O
(    O
