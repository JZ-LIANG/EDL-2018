While    O
the    O
rationale    O
for    O
this    O

—    O
that    O

were    O
agents    B-LegalProfession108112402

their    O

and    O
that    O
any    O

should    O
therefore    O
be    O
taxed    O
as    O
personal    O
income    O
once    O

and    O
not    O
as    O
corporate    O
income    O
pre    O

disbursal    O
—    O
was    O
initially    O
accepted    O
,    O
the    O
UGG    O
argued    O
that    O
the    O
pools    O

reorganization    O
eliminated    O
the    O
differences    O
between    O
them    O

the    O
UGG    O
,    O
and    O
that    O
the    O

put    O

at    O
