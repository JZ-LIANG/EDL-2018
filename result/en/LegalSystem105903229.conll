was    O
the    O
leading    O
advocate    O
of    O

(    O
sometimes    O
also    O
called    O

in    O

1999    O

Near    O
the    O
end    O
of    O
the    O
2006    O
campaign    O
,    O
sensing    O
the    O
momentum    O
that    O
would    O
result    O
in    O
a    O
Conservative    O
victory    O
,    O
NDP    O
leader    O
Jack    O
Layton    O
defied    O
Paul    O
Martin    O
and    O
Hargrove    O
's    O
pleas    O
to    O
unite    B-LegalSystem105903229
all    I-LegalSystem105903229
progressive    O
voters    O
under    O
the    O
Liberal    O
banner    O
.    O

They    O
took    O
a    O
smaller    O
share    O
of    O
the    O
vote    O
than    O
at    O
the    O
previous    O
election    O
,    O
but    O
they    O
managed    O
to    O
more    O
than    O
double    O
their    O
representation    O
in    O
parliament    O
,    O
winning    O
46    O
seats    O
,    O
through    O
tactical    B-LegalSystem105903229

concentrating    O
resources    O

Like    O
many    O
other    O
voting    O
systems    O
,    O
the    O
Borda    O
count    O
is    O
vulnerable    O
to    O
tactical    B-LegalSystem105903229
voting    I-LegalSystem105903229
.    O

Martin    O
suggested    O
that    O
tactical    B-LegalSystem105903229
voting    I-LegalSystem105903229
was    O
to    O
blame    O
as    O
well    O
,    O
as    O
the    O
anti    O

PC    O
vote    O
consolidated    O
around    O
the    O
Liberals    O
.    O

All    O
three    O
major    O
parties    O
(    O
Conservative    O
,    O
Labour    O
and    O
Liberal    O
)    O
had    O
significant    O
support    O
in    O
the    O
seat    O
and    O
Forman    O
’s    O
position    O
was    O
therefore    O
always    O
potentially    O
vulnerable    O
to    O
tactical    B-LegalSystem105903229
voting    I-LegalSystem105903229
.    O

Several    O
factors    O
led    O
to    O
this    O
poor    O
showing    O
,    O
including    O
a    O
lacklustre    O
campaign    O
,    O
Hampton    O
's    O
low    O
profile    O
,    O
and    O
a    O
movement    O
called    O
strategic    B-LegalSystem105903229
voting    I-LegalSystem105903229
that    O
endorsed    O
voting    O
for    O
the    O
Liberals    O
in    O
most    O
ridings    O
in    O
order    O
to    O
remove    O
the    O
governing    O
Tories    O
.    O

Further    O
,    O
the    O
system    O
encouraged    O
tactical    B-LegalSystem105903229
voting    I-LegalSystem105903229
,    O
with    O
many    O
UKIP    O
supporters    O
believing    O
that    O
a    O
vote    O
for    O
the    O
party    O
would    O
be    O
a    O
wasted    O
vote    O
.    O

The    O
HDP    O
managed    O
to    O
surpass    O
the    O
10%    O
election    O
threshold    O
with    O
13%    O
,    O
higher    O
than    O
expectations    O
and    O
mainly    O
attributed    O
to    O
tactical    B-LegalSystem105903229
voting    I-LegalSystem105903229
by    O
CHP    O
and    O
AKP    O
voters    O
to    O
make    O
sure    O
that    O
the    O
party    O
would    O
surpass    O
the    O
threshold    O
.    O

HDP    O
MP    O
Sırrı    O
Süreyya    O
Önder    O
also    O
stated    O
that    O
the    O
HDP    O
was    O
aware    O
that    O
many    O
voters    O
voted    B-LegalSystem105903229
tactically    I-LegalSystem105903229
to    O
ensure    O
that    O
the    O
HDP    O
passed    O
the    O
10%    O
threshold    O
,    O
claiming    O
that    O
the    O
party    O
would    O
not    O
alienate    O
these    O
voters    O
.    O

They    O
argue    O
that    O
it    O
can    O
result    O
in    O
the    O
defeat    O
of    O
a    O

would    O
win    O
an    O
absolute    O
majority    O
in    O
a    O

election    O
,    O
can    O

Voting    B-LegalSystem105903229
strategy    I-LegalSystem105903229
is    O
a    O
way    O
to    O
make    O
that    O
choice    O

with    O

The    O
presence    O
of    O

remain    O

the    O
lives    O
of    O
the    O

downtrodden    O
apparently    O
also    O

her    O
to    O

Major    O
sources    O
of    O
difference    O
between    O
these    O
groups    O
are    O
their    O
approaches    O
to    O
Jewish    B-LegalSystem105903229
law    I-LegalSystem105903229
,    O
the    O
authority    O
of    O
the    O
Rabbinic    O
tradition    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
significance    O
of    O
the    O
State    O
of    O
Israel    O
.    O

These    O
commandments    O
are    O
but    O
two    O
of    O
a    O
large    O
corpus    O
of    O
commandments    O
and    O
laws    B-LegalSystem105903229
that    O
constitute    O
this    O
covenant    O
,    O
which    O
is    O
the    O
substance    O
of    O
Judaism    O
.    O

This    O
is    O
played    O
out    O
through    O
the    O
observance    O
of    O
the    O
Halakha    B-LegalSystem105903229
(    O
Jewish    O
law    O
)    O
and    O
given    O
verbal    O
expression    O
in    O
the    O
Birkat    O
Ha    O
-    O
Mizvot    O
,    O
the    O
short    O
blessings    O
that    O
are    O
spoken    O
every    O
time    O
a    O
positive    O
commandment    O
is    O
to    O
be    O
fulfilled    O
.    O

Whereas    O
Jewish    O
philosophers    O
often    O
debate    O
whether    O
God    O
is    O
immanent    O
or    O
transcendent    O
,    O
and    O
whether    O
people    O
have    O
free    O
will    O
or    O
their    O
lives    O
are    O
determined    O
,    O
Halakha    B-LegalSystem105903229
is    O
a    O
system    O
through    O
which    O
any    O
Jew    O
acts    O
to    O
bring    O
God    O
into    O
the    O
world    O
.    O

Thus    O
for    O
instance    O
,    O
Joseph    O
Soloveitchik    O
's    O
(    O
associated    O
with    O
the    O
Modern    O
Orthodox    O
movement    O
)    O
answer    O
to    O
modernity    O
is    O
constituted    O
upon    O
the    O
identification    O
of    O
Judaism    O
with    O
following    O
the    O
halakha    B-LegalSystem105903229
whereas    O
its    O
ultimate    O
goal    O
is    O
to    O
bring    O
the    O
holiness    O
down    O
to    O
the    O
world    O
.    O

Halakhic    B-LegalSystem105903229
literature    O

It    O
is    O
characterised    O
by    O
the    O
belief    O
that    O
the    O
Written    O
Torah    O
(    O
Written    O
Law    O
)    O
can    O
not    O
be    O
correctly    O
interpreted    O
without    O
reference    O
to    O
the    O
Oral    O
Torah    O
and    O
the    O
voluminous    O
literature    O
specifying    O
what    O
behavior    O
is    O
sanctioned    O
by    O
the    O
Law    B-LegalSystem105903229
.    O

Jewish    O
ethics    O
may    O
be    O
guided    O
by    O
halakhic    B-LegalSystem105903229
traditions    O
,    O
by    O
other    O
moral    O
principles    O
,    O
or    O
by    O
central    O
Jewish    O
virtues    O
.    O

Survival    O
concerns    O
supersede    O
all    O
the    O
laws    O
of    O
"    O

"    O
,    O
as    O
they    O
do    O
for    O
most    O
halakhot    B-LegalSystem105903229
.    O

Israel    O
today    O
functions    O
mostly    O
as    O
a    O
secular    O
state    O
,    O
and    O
has    O
many    O
laws    O
which    O
conflict    O
with    O
Halacha    B-LegalSystem105903229
.    O

United    O
Torah    O
Judaism    O
and    O
Shas    O
,    O
which    O
advocate    O
for    O
a    O
halachic    B-LegalSystem105903229
state    O
,    O
are    O
the    O
only    O
two    O
Haredi    O
parties    O
in    O
the    O
Israeli    O
Knesset    O
.    O

However    O
,    O
there    O
is    O
also    O
an    O
Halachic    B-LegalSystem105903229
standpoint    O
which    O
makes    O
the    O
case    O
against    O
Zionism    O
even    O
if    O
Israel    O
would    O
-    O
hypothetically    O
-    O
have    O
been    O
a    O
theocracy    O
,    O
where    O
Israel    O
would    O
have    O
been    O
governed    O
under    O
strict    O
Jewish    O
laws    O
.    O

Originally    O
,    O
the    O
term    O
referred    O
to    O
a    O
Jew    O
who    O
transgressed    O
the    O
halakhah    B-LegalSystem105903229
(    O
Jewish    O
law    O
)    O
knowingly    O
or    O
unknowingly    O
and    O
completed    O
a    O
process    O
of    O
introspection    O
to    O
"    O
return    O
"    O
to    O
the    O
full    O
observance    O
of    O
God    O
's    O
mitzvot    O
.    O

Because    O
scissors    O
have    O
two    O
blades    O
,    O
some    O
opinions    O
in    O
halakha    B-LegalSystem105903229
(    O
Jewish    O
law    O
)    O
permit    O
their    O
use    O
to    O
trim    O
the    O
beard    O
,    O
as    O
the    O
cutting    O
action    O
comes    O
from    O
contact    O
of    O
the    O
two    O
blades    O
,    O
and    O
not    O
the    O
blade    O
against    O
the    O
skin    O
.    O

For    O
this    O
reason    O
,    O
some    O
poskim    O
(    O
Jewish    O
legal    O
deciders    O
)    O
rule    O
that    O
Orthodox    O
Jews    O
may    O
use    O
electric    O
razors    O
to    O
remain    O
clean    O
-    O
shaven    O
,    O
as    O
such    O
shavers    O
cut    O
by    O
trapping    O
the    O
hair    O
between    O
the    O
blades    O
and    O
the    O
metal    O
grating    O
,    O
halakhically    B-LegalSystem105903229
a    O
scissor    O
-    O
like    O
action    O
.    O

He    O
also    O
studies    O
the    O
modern    O
process    O
of    O
Halachic    B-LegalSystem105903229
decision    O
making    O
.    O

He    O
has    O
also    O
written    O
three    O
books    O
:    O
a    O
halachic    B-LegalSystem105903229
work    O
based    O
on    O
the    O
decisions    O
of    O
his    O
mentor    O
Rabbi    O
Scheinberg    O
,    O
a    O
guide    O
to    O
the    O
laws    O

,    O
a    O
discussion    O
of    O
the    O
prohibition    O
of    O
seclusion    O
between    O
men    O
and    O
women    O
.    O

This    O
resulted    O
in    O
several    O
hundreds    O
of    O
thousands    O
of    O
persons    O
fitting    O
the    O
above    O
criteria    O
immigrating    O
to    O
Israel    O
(    O
mainly    O
from    O
the    O
former    O
Soviet    O
Union    O
)    O
but    O
not    O
being    O
recognized    O
as    O
Jews    O
by    O
the    O

religious    O
authorities    O
,    O
which    O
on    O
the    O
basis    O
of    O

recognize    O
only    O
the    O

These    O

Jewish    O
anarchists    O
personally    O
observed    O
the    O

supported    O

of    O

or    O

According    O
to    O
the    O
Hasidic    O
esoteric    O
philosophy    O
,    O
the    O
Halacha    B-LegalSystem105903229
is    O
not    O
a    O
set    O
of    O
laws    O
,    O
imposed    O
by    O
an    O
external    O
authority    O
(    O
since    O
in    O
panentheistic    O
view    O
God    O

never    O
"    O

but    O
a    O
framework    O
of    O
means    O
for    O
spiritual    O
self    O
-    O
development    O
,    O
somewhat    O
similar    O
to    O
the    O
Eastern    O
concept    O
of    O
Dharma    O
.    O

Halacha    B-LegalSystem105903229
itself    O
is    O
open    O
to    O
inquiry    O
,    O
though    O
actual    O
change    O
or    O
violation    O
of    O
halachic    O
norms    O
,    O
according    O
to    O
traditional    O
Hasidism    O
,    O
usually    O
requires    O
extensive    O
expertise    O
and    O
mystical    O
knowledge    O
,    O
and    O
should    O
be    O
taken    O
with    O
great    O
caution    O
.    O

According    O
to    O
some    O
Kabbalists    O
,    O
in    O
the    O
Messianic    O
world    O
the    O
standardized    O
Halacha    B-LegalSystem105903229
will    O
be    O
abolished    O
,    O
because    O
everyone    O
will    O
realize    O
his    O
/    O
her    O
personal    O
spiritual    O
path    O
by    O
personal    O
intuition    O
.    O

Often    O
today    O
,    O
Rabbis    O
are    O
considered    O
to    O
be    O
just    O
more    O
knowledgeable    O
people    O
,    O
who    O
serve    O
as    O
advisors    O
and    O
analyze    O
how    O
the    O
Halacha    B-LegalSystem105903229
applies    O
to    O
different    O
situations    O
,    O
although    O
some    O
rabbinical    O
figures    O
and    O
organizations    O
impose    O
their    O
authority    O
though    O
coercive    O
means    O
.    O

Judaism    O
accepts    O
that    O
truth    O
is    O
relative    O
to    O
some    O
extent    O
and    O
that    O
the    O
opposite    O
Halachic    B-LegalSystem105903229
opinions    O
can    O
both    O
be    O
right    O
,    O
although    O
this    O
idea    O
is    O
usually    O
not    O
generalized    O
beyond    O
some    O
traditional    O
contexts    O
.    O

Because    O
Jewish    B-LegalSystem105903229
law    I-LegalSystem105903229
forbids    O
taking    O
oaths    O
,    O
during    O
his    O
swearing    O
-    O
in    O
ceremony    O
Bedrick    O
substituted    O
the    O
words    O
"    O

in    O
violation    O
with    O
Jewish    B-LegalSystem105903229
law    I-LegalSystem105903229
,    O
when    O
in    O
reality    O
they    O
are    O
fully    O

are    O

Halacha    B-LegalSystem105903229

.    O

This    O
was    O
a    O
bold    O
step    O
for    O
a    O
cantor    O
who    O
declared    O
himself    O
to    O
be    O
Orthodox    O
,    O
since    O
the    O
idea    O
of    O

woman    O
cantor    O
was    O
considered    O
counter    O
to    O

Many    O
religious    O
authorities    O
,    O
including    O
the    O
Chief    O
Rabbinate    O
,    O
interpret    O
halakha    B-LegalSystem105903229
(    O
Jewish    O
law    O
)    O
as    O
prohibiting    O
entering    O
the    O
area    O
to    O
prevent    O
inadvertently    O
entering    O
and    O
desecrating    O
forbidden    O
areas    O
(    O
such    O
as    O
the    O
Holy    O
of    O
Holies    O
)    O
,    O
as    O
the    O
Temple    O
area    O
is    O
regarded    O
as    O
still    O
retaining    O
its    O
full    O
sanctity    O
and    O
restrictions    O
.    O

A    O
major    O
problem    O
with    O
this    O
interpretation    O
is    O
that    O
Jewish    O
religious    O
law    O
(    O
halacha    B-LegalSystem105903229
)    O
generally    O
forbids    O
embalming    O
and    O
therefore    O
Jews    O
generally    O
bury    O
their    O
dead    O
as    O
soon    O
as    O
possible    O
:    O
"    O
Jewish    O
burials    O
take    O
place    O
as    O
quickly    O
as    O
possible    O
,    O
following    O
a    O
principle    O
of    O
honoring    O
the    O
dead    O

This    O
is    O
remarkable    O
because    O
Bavaria    O
–    O

–    O
has    O

three    O

this    O

In    O

His    O
surpassing    O
merit    O
