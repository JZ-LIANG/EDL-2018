the    O

often    O
extended    O
to    O

as    O
the    O
new    O
Israelites    O
,    O
for    O

German    O

He    O
would    O
later    O
(    O
e.g.    O
in    O
June    O
1919    O
)    O
defend    O
the    O
decision    O
to    O
save    O
lives    O
and    O
money    O
by    O
offering    O

an    O

she    O
was    O
clearly    O
beaten    O
,    O
although    O
with    O
hindsight    O
this    O
allowed    O
the    O
myth    O
to    O
grow    O
up    O
that    O
Germany    B-Legend106371413
had    I-Legend106371413
not    I-Legend106371413
really    I-Legend106371413
been    I-Legend106371413
defeated    I-Legend106371413
.    O

Like    O
many    O
Germans    O
of    O
the    O
period    O
,    O
Hitler    O
believed    O
that    O
the    O
treaty    O
was    O
a    O
betrayal    O
,    O
with    O
the    O
country    O
having    O
been    O
"stabbed    B-Legend106371413
in    I-Legend106371413
the    I-Legend106371413
back"    I-Legend106371413
by    O
its    O
own    O
government    O
,    O
particularly    O
as    O
the    O
German    O
Army    O
was    O
popularly    O
thought    O
to    O
have    O
been    O
undefeated    O
in    O
the    O
field    O
.    O

According    O
to    O
Griech    O
-    O
Polelle    O
,    O
he    O
believed    O
the    O
Dolchstosslegende    B-Legend106371413
explained    O
the    O
German    O
army    O
's    O
defeat    O
in    O
1918    O
.    O

They    O
held    O
a    O
shared    O
belief    O
in    O
the    O
stab-in-the-back    B-Legend106371413
myth    I-Legend106371413
,    O
the    O
notion    O
that    O
Germany    O
's    O
loss    O
in    O
World    O
War    O
I    O
was    O
caused    O
by    O
a    O
conspiracy    O
of    O
Jews    O
and    O
Bolsheviks    O
rather    O
than    O
a    O
military    O
defeat    O
.    O

During    O
the    O
Weimar    O
Republic    O
the    O
popular    O
perception    O
that    O
Germany    O
had    O
been    O
stabbed    B-Legend106371413
in    I-Legend106371413
the    I-Legend106371413
back    I-Legend106371413
rendered    O
the    O
public    O
vulnerable    O
to    O
the    O
Nazis    O
,    O
who    O
embraced    O
the    O
language    O
of    O
the    O
Spirit    O
of    O
1914    O
in    O
their    O
aim    O
of    O
seizing    O
power    O
throughout    O
Germany    O
.    O

This    O
stands    O
in    O
contrast    O
to    O
General    O
Erich    O
Ludendorff    O
who    O
spent    O
his    O
post    O
-    O
war    O
years    O
promoting    O
a    O
Far    O
Right    O
stab-in-the-back    B-Legend106371413
legend    I-Legend106371413
that    O
blamed    O
the    O
German    O
defeat    O
without    O
an    O
honorable    O
peace    O
on    O
Marxists    O
and    O
Republicans    O
at    O
home    O
.    O

The    O
considerations    O
behind    O
this    O
recommendation    O
were    O
to    O
prevent    O
the    O
repetition    O
of    O
the    O
stab-in-the-back    B-Legend106371413
legend    I-Legend106371413
,    O

in    O
Germany    O
following    O
defeat    O
in    O
the    O
First    O
World    O
War    O
;    O
since    O
the    O
act    O
of    O
surrender    O
in    O
November    O
1918    O
had    O
been    O
signed    O
only    O
by    O
representatives    O
of    O
the    O
civilian    O
German    O
government    O
;    O
militarist    O
circles    O
would    O
subsequently    O
claim    O
that    O
the    O
High    O
Command    O
of    O
the    O
Army    O
carried    O
no    O
responsibility    O
for    O
the    O
instrument    O
of    O
defeat    O
.    O

Many    O

did    O
not    O
accept    O
that    O
their    O
country    O
had    O
been    O

argues    O
that    O
the    O
concept    O
of    O
a    O
higher    O
power    O
represents    O
a    O
masculine    O
perception    O
of    O
spiritual    O
recovery    O
,    O
such    O
as    O

Odysseus    O
,    O
Icarus    O
and    O
Percival    B-Legend106371413
,    O
and    O
that    O
the    O
archetypal    O
feminine    O
heroic    O
journey    O
is    O
a    O
chthonic    O
underworld    O
journey    O
,    O
lower    O
and    O
deeper    O
;    O

The    O

The    O
action    O
takes    O

just    O
