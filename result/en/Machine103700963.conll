Many    O

had    O
been    O

The    O

reduction    O

from    O

,    O
making    O
them    O
much    O
narrower    O
than    O
in    O
1997    O
;    O
a    O
previous    O
reduction    O
in    O
track    O
occurred    O
in    O
,    O
when    O
the    O
cars    O
were    O
reduced    O
from    O
to    O
2    O
m.    O
The    O
second    O
change    O
was    O
the    O
introduction    O
of    O
grooved    O
tyres    O
to    O
replace    O
slicks    O
:    O
the    O
front    O
tyres    O
had    O
three    O
grooves    O
,    O
with    O
four    O
on    O
the    O
rear    O
tyres    O
.    O

The    O
first    O
was    O
the    O
reduction    O
of    O
the    O
cars    O
'    O
track    B-Machine103700963
,    O
from    O
to    O
;    O
the    O
second    O
was    O
a    O
considerable    O
reduction    O
in    O
tyre    O
width    O
(    O
particularly    O
the    O
rears    O
)    O
,    O
so    O
as    O
to    O
provide    O
less    O
grip    O
than    O
the    O
previously    O
'    O
fat    O
'    O
slicks    O
.    O

Therefore    O
,    O
wheelbases    O
are    O

within    O
a    O
tenth    O
of    O
an    O
inch    O
of    O
each    O
other    O
,    O
and    O
are    O
about    O
two    O
inches    O
narrower    O
than    O
the    O
front    O

then    O
an    O

James    O
Green    O
(    O
1781â1849    O

was    O
a    O
noted    O
civil    O
engineer    O
and    O
canal    O
engineer    O
,    O
who    O
was    O
particularly    O
active    O
in    O
the    O
South    O
West    O
of    O
England    O
,    O
where    O
he    O
pioneered    O
the    O
building    O
of    O
tub    O
boat    O
canals    O
,    O
and    O
inventive    O
solutions    O
for    O

solution    O
was    O
to    O
advocate    O
the    O
use    O
of    O
tub    O
boats    O
,    O
which    O
were    O

transporting    O
between    O
five    O

eight    O
tons    O
of    O

alter    O
the    O
