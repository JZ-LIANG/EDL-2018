is    O
a    O
part    O
of    O

which    O
includes    O
a    O
variety    O
of    O

attempt    O
to    O

One    O
of    O
the    O
most    O
common    O
types    O
of    O
ECM    B-Maneuver100168237
is    O
radar    O
jamming    O
or    O
spoofing    O
.    O

On    O
the    O
latest    O
models    O
,    O
this    O
vehicle    O
is    O
also    O
fitted    O
with    O
an    O
optical    O

system    O
which    O
allows    O
engagement    O
without    O
the    O

in    O
which    O
case    O
the    O

altitude    O
is    O
limited    O
to    O
14    O
km/46000    O

It    O
is    O
also    O
able    O
to    O
engage    O
lower    O
flying    O
targets    O
than    O
the    O
previous    O
systems    O
,    O
and    O
being    O
more    O
modern    O
it    O
is    O
much    O
more    O
resistant    O
to    O
ECM    B-Maneuver100168237
than    O
the    O
S-75    O
.    O

Optical    O
tracking    O
is    O
possible    O
for    O

in    O
a    O
heavy    O
ECM    B-Maneuver100168237
environment    O

adds    O

It    O
also    O
used    O

.    O

While    O
Bolo    O
models    O
generally    O
opted    O
for    O
a    O
"    O

"    O
approach    O
to    O
offensive    O
and    O
defensive    O
capabilities    O
,    O
there    O
were    O
often    O
specialised    O
variations    O
on    O
the    O
base    O
model    O
,    O
such    O
as    O
heavy    O

and    O

It    O
is    O
designed    O
for    O
effective    O
detection    O
of    O
targets    O
at    O
low    O
altitude    O
in    O
both    O
ECM    B-Maneuver100168237
and    O
natural    O
clutter    O
environments    O
.    O

An    O
ECM    B-Maneuver100168237
pod    O
provides    O
defense    O
against    O
enemy    O

,    O
but    O
occupies    O
an    O

Also    O
,    O
the    O

was    O
rather    O
quickly    O
compromised    O
because    O
of    O

and    O
its    O
weaknesses    O
were    O
well    O
known    O
to    O
