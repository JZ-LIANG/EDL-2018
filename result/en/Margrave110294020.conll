Certain    O
is    O
that    O

The    O

popular    O

After    O
the    O

According    O
to    O
"    O
"    O
of    O
1897    O
(    O
under    O
the    O
heading    O

)    O
,    O
the    O
German    O
Imperial    O
Banner    O
at    O
the    O
time    O
of    O
Henry    O

Fowler    O
(    O
919–936    O
)    O
and    O
Otto    O
the    O
Great    O
(    O
936–973    O
)    O
depicted    O
the    O
Archangel    O
Michael    O
;    O
at    O
the    O
time    O
of    O
Frederick    O
Barbarossa    O
(    O
1155–90    O
)    O
,    O
an    O
eagle    O
;    O
at    O
the    O
time    O
of    O
Otto    O
IV    O
(    O
1209–15    O
)    O
an    O
eagle    O
hovering    O
over    O
a    O
dragon    O
,    O
and    O
since    O
the    O
time    O
of    O
Sigismund    B-Margrave110294020
(    O
1433–37    O
)    O
,    O
and    O
"    O
perhaps    O
earlier    O
"    O
,    O
the    O
Imperial    O
Eagle    O
,    O
namely    O
a    O
black    O
eagle    O
in    O
a    O
yellow    O
field    O
,    O
bearing    O
the    O
arms    O
of    O
the    O
emperor    O
's    O
house    O
on    O
its    O
breast    O
.    O

Thus    O
,    O
king    B-Margrave110294020
Sigismund    I-Margrave110294020
gave    O
the    O

to    O
the    O
Swiss    O

sanctioning    O
their    O
war    O
against    O
the    O

in    O
1415    O

Maybe    O
linked    O
to    O
this    O
fact    O
is    O
the    O

In    O
early    O
1553    O
he    O
was    O
sent    O
on    O
a    O
diplomatic    O
mission    O
to    O
the    O
Emperor    B-Margrave110294020
Charles    I-Margrave110294020
V    I-Margrave110294020
to    O
suggest    O
peace    O

between    O

Sir    O
Richard    O
Morrison    O
,    O
the    O
English    O
resident    O
ambassador    O
with    O
Charles    B-Margrave110294020
V    I-Margrave110294020
,    O
knew    O
nothing    O
of    O
this    O
until    O
he    O
met    O
Dudley    O
at    O
Treves    O
.    O

Since    O
1930    O
,    O
the    O
Ommegang    O
of    O
Brussels    O
has    O
taken    O
the    O
form    O
of    O
a    O
historical    O
reenactment    O
of    O
the    O
entry    O
of    O
Emperor    B-Margrave110294020
Charles    I-Margrave110294020

and    O
his    O
son    O

in    O
Brussels    O
in    O
1549    O
.    O

From    O
the    O
mid-16th    O
century    O
,    O
the    O
Ommegang    O
not    O
only    O
celebrated    O
the    O
miraculous    O
legend    O
,    O
but    O
became    O
intertwined    O
with    O
the    O
Joyous    O
Entry    O
of    O
Holy    O
Roman    O
Emperor    O
Charles    B-Margrave110294020
V    I-Margrave110294020
The    O
Ommegang    O
thus    O
developed    O
into    O
an    O
important    O
religious    O
and    O
civil    O
event    O
in    O
the    O
annual    O
calendar    O
of    O
Brussels    O
.    O

When    O
it    O
was    O
revealed    O
in    O
1514    O
that    O
he    O
was    O
planning    O
to    O
relinquish    O
the    O
bishopric    O
to    O
a    O
candidate    O
of    O
King    O
Louis    O
XII    O
of    O
France    O
,    O
he    O
lost    O
the    O
support    O
of    O
Charles    B-Margrave110294020
V,    I-Margrave110294020

Emperor    I-Margrave110294020
,    O
who    O
forced    O
him    O
to    O
resign    O
on    O
9    O
May    O
1517    O
.    O

In    O
a    O
politically    O
motivated    O
move    O
,    O
Philip    O
was    O
appointed    O
bishop    O
of    O
Utrecht    O
by    O
Charles    B-Margrave110294020

to    O
replace    O
Frederick    O
IV    O
of    O
Baden    O
.    O

But    O
he    O
lacked    O
the    O
support    O
of    O

Charles    O
,    O
Duke    O
of    O
Guelders    O
,    O
who    O
made    O
life    O
difficult    O
for    O
him    O
.    O

After    O
the    O
death    O
of    O
Adrian    O
in    O
1523    O
,    O
William    O

Enckevoirt    O
maintained    O
his    O
high    O

and    O
continued    O
his    O
involvement    O
in    O
politics    O

as    O

in    O
