into    O
a    O
formidable    O

since    O
he    O
believed    O

somewhere    O

area    O
,    O

in    O

opposition    O

the    O

take    O
the    O

this    O
matter    O
between    O
Maurice    O
and    O
Van    O

,    O
was    O
an    O

of    O

were    O
beginning    O
to    O
drift    O
apart    O
;    O
this    O
rivalry    O
would    O
eventually    O
lead    O
to    O
the    O
arrest    O

execution    O
