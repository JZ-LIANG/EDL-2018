there    O

However    O
,    O
this    O

of    O

directly    O
,    O

was    O

was    O
a    O
type    O
of    O

used    O
during    O
the    O
Early    B-MiddleAge115153472

Hovey    O
was    O
an    O
Anglo-Saxon    B-MiddleAge115153472
Protestant    O
but    O
they    O
had    O
little    O
protest    O
from    O
either    O
of    O
their    O
families    O
and    O
even    O
decided    O
to    O
declare    O
their    O
own    O
children    O
Jewish    O
,    O
although    O
they    O
would    O
not    O

on    O
them    O

Many    O
of    O

could    O
trace    O
their    O
origin    O

medieval    O
charters    O

were    O
boroughs    O
by    O
prescription    O
,    O
with    O
Saxon    B-MiddleAge115153472
origins    O
.    O

A    O
more    O
likely    O
explanation    O
is    O
from    O
the    O
Anglo-Saxon    B-MiddleAge115153472
word    O
"    O
lear    O
"    O
meaning    O
empty    O

One    O
example    O
of    O
this    O
is    O
that    O
when    O
the    O
Bible    O
was    O
translated    O
into    O
Anglo-Saxon    B-MiddleAge115153472
,    O
Norman    O
French    O
was    O
still    O
common    O
among    O
the    O
aristocracy    O
,    O
so    O
expressions    O
like    O
"    O
save    O
and    O
except    O
"    O
were    O
translated    O
both    O
for    O
the    O
commoners    O
and    O
the    O
aristocrats    O
;    O
although    O
in    O
this    O
case    O
both    O
"    O
save    O
"    O
and    O
"    O
except    O
"    O
have    O
a    O

origin    O

equally    O

the    O

of    O
the    O

the    O

This    O
places    O
each    O

in    O
about    O
the    O

,    O
though    O

is    O
that    O
the    O

of    O
Alemannic    O
origin    O
,    O
and    O
that    O
when    O
the    O
Franks    B-MiddleAge115153472
drove    O
the    O

)    O
,    O
slight    O
remnants    O
of    O
settlement    O
persisted    O
,    O
and    O
thus    O
the    O
Alemannic    O
word    O
for    O
“    O
brook    O
”    O
was    O
retained    O
and    O
adopted    O
(    O
the    O
modern    O
German    O
word    O
for    O

After    O
the    O
Franks    B-MiddleAge115153472
had    O
ﬁnished    O
taking    O
the    O
land    O

about    O
the    O

Weitersbach    O
long    O
remained    O

In    O
order    O
to    O
maintain    O
necessary    O
good    O
relations    O
with    O
the    O
Byzantine    O

He    O
Ru    O
was    O
ordered    O
to    O
begin    O
manufacturing    O
breech    O
-    O
loading    O
cannons    O
in    O
the    O
same    O
style    O

the    O
captured    O
Portuguese    O
breech    O

loading    O
swivel    O
guns    O
,    O
which    O
were    O
called    O
"    O

"    O
(    O

)    O
,    O
meaning    O
"    O
Frankish    B-MiddleAge115153472
"    O
in    O
Chinese    O
.    O

For    O
instance    O
,    O
he    O
motivated    O
the    O
Franks    B-MiddleAge115153472
in    O
siding    O
with    O
the    O
Papacy    O
,    O
rather    O
than    O
the    O
Byzantines    O
;    O
this    O
was    O
a    O
strategic    O
diplomatic    O
initiative    O
that    O
would    O
end    O
with    O
Charlemagne    O
becoming    O
the    O
Emperor    O
from    O
800    O
-    O

;    O
but    O
Fulrad    O
would    O
not    O
see    O
the    O
result    O
of    O
his    O
actions    O
,    O
as    O
it    O
occurred    O
eleven    O
years    O
after    O
his    O
death    O
in    O
784    O
.    O

The    O
reason    O
for    O
this    O
meeting    O
with    O
the    O
papacy    O
was    O
to    O
make    O
clear    O
and    O
make    O
sure    O
that    O
Pippin    O
,    O
and    O
not    O
Childeric    O
should    O
be    O
king    O
of    O
the    O
Franks    B-MiddleAge115153472
.    O

Soissons    O
was    O
the    O
birthplace    O
of    O
the    O
Frankish    B-MiddleAge115153472
Prince    O
Charlemagne    O
in    O
the    O
year    O
747    O
,    O
son    O
of    O
King    O
Pippin    O
the    O
Short    O
and    O
Bertrada    O
of    O
Laon    O
.    O

In    O
869    O
he    O
was    O
sent    O
by    O
Louis    O
II    O
,    O
Holy    O
Roman    O
Emperor    O
as    O
envoy    O
to    O
Constantinople    O
,    O
with    O
two    O
men    O
of    O
high    O
rank    O
in    O
the    O
Frankish    B-MiddleAge115153472
Empire    O
,    O
to    O
negotiate    O
a    O
marriage    O
between    O
Leo    O
VI    O
the    O
Wise    O
,    O
oldest    O
son    O
of    O
the    O
Eastern    O
Roman    O
emperor    O
Basil    O
I    O
,    O
and    O

Therefore    O
,    O
scholars    O
often    O
draw    O
from    O
literary    O
sources    O
produced    O
by    O
neighbouring    O
societies    O
,    O
such    O
as    O
the    O
continental    O
Franks    B-MiddleAge115153472
and    O
Goths    O
,    O
or    O
later    O
Vikings    O
.    O

In    O
Old    O
English    O
and    O
other    O
Germanic    O
languages    O
,    O
which    O
were    O
spoken    O
across    O
much    O
of    O
Northwestern    O
Europe    O
,    O
tribal    O
groups    O
often    O
had    O
names    O
that    O
appear    O
to    O
be    O
based    O
upon    O
the    O
names    O
of    O
weapons    O
;    O
for    O
instance    O
,    O
the    O
Angles    B-MiddleAge115153472
may    O
have    O
taken    O
their    O
name    O
from    O
the    O
Old    O
English    O
term    O
"    O
angul    O
"    O
(    O
meaning    O
"    O
barbed    O
"    O
or    O
"    O
hook    O
"    O
)    O
,    O
the    O
Franks    B-MiddleAge115153472
from    O
the    O
word    O
"    O
franca    O
"    O
(    O
"    O
spear    O
,    O
"    O
or    O
possibly    O
"    O
axe    O
"    O
)    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
Saxons    O
from    O
"    O
seax    O
"    O
(    O
"    O
knife    O
"    O
)    O
.    O

Thus    O
,    O
the    O
"    O
seax    O
"    O
is    O
primarily    O
associated    O
with    O
the    O
Franks    B-MiddleAge115153472
.    O

In    O
all    O
likelihood    O
he    O
was    O
already    O
duke    O
under    O
Desiderius    O
,    O
notwithstanding    O
some    O
Frankish    B-MiddleAge115153472
sources    O
,    O
such    O
as    O
the    O
"    O
Einhardis    O
annales    O
"    O
,    O
who    O
say    O
that    O
Charlemagne    O
put    O
him    O
in    O
power    O
after    O
the    O
Siege    O
of    O
Pavia    O
.    O

Hadrian    O
believed    O
that    O

conspiracy    O
of    O
Lombards    O
and    O
Byzantines    O
,    O
led    O
by    O
Arechis    O
II    O
of    O
Benevento    O
,    O
Hildeprand    O
of    O

With    O
the    O
concept    O
of    O

horde    O
,    O
the    O

tried    O
to    O
reflect    O
the    O

For    O
example    O
,    O
Medieval    B-MiddleAge115153472
England    I-MiddleAge115153472
saw    O
marriage    O
age    O
as    O
variable    O
depending    O
on    O
economic    O
circumstances    O
,    O
with    O
couples    O
delaying    O
marriage    O
until    O
the    O
early    O
twenties    O
when    O
times    O
were    O
bad    O
and    O
falling    O
to    O
the    O
late    O
teens    O
after    O
the    O
Black    B-MiddleAge115153472
Death    I-MiddleAge115153472
,    O
when    O
there    O
were    O
labor    O
shortages    O
;    O
by    O
appearances    O
,    O
marriage    O
of    O
adolescents    O
was    O
not    O
the    O
norm    O
in    O
England    O
.    O

In    O
better    O
times    O
,    O
more    O
people    O
could    O
afford    O
to    O
marry    O
earlier    O
and    O
thus    O
fertility    O
rose    O
and    O
conversely    O
marriages    O
were    O
delayed    O
or    O
forgone    O
when    O
times    O
were    O
bad    O
,    O
thus    O
restricting    O
family    O
size    O
;    O
after    O
the    O
Black    B-MiddleAge115153472
Death    I-MiddleAge115153472
,    O
the    O
greater    O
availability    O
of    O
profitable    O
jobs    O
allowed    O
more    O
people    O
to    O
marry    O
young    O
and    O
have    O
more    O
children    O
,    O
but    O
the    O
stabilization    O
of    O
the    O
population    O
in    O
the    O
16th    O
century    O
meant    O
fewer    O
job    O
opportunities    O
and    O
thus    O
more    O
people    O
delaying    O
marriages    O
.    O

This    O
disrepute    O
was    O
worsened    O
by    O
the    O
appearance    O

and    O
population    O
collapse    O
of    O
the    O

made    O
labour    O
expensive    O
and    O
land    O
relatively    O
cheap    O
,    O
encouraging    O

to    O
look    O
for    O
money    O
from    O

,    O
with    O
which    O
they    O
paid    O

However    O
,    O
this    O
pattern    O
would    O
have    O
collapsed    O
from    O
the    O
mid-14th    O

,    O
as    O
the    O
Black    B-MiddleAge115153472

reduced    O

According    O
to    O
the    O
historian    O
Antony    O
Carr    O
,    O
the    O
timing    O
suggests    O
that    O
the    O
priests    O
had    O
been    O
victims    O
of    O
the    O
Black    B-MiddleAge115153472

,    O
and    O
he    O
notes    O
that    O
"    O
the    O
clergy    O
as    O
a    O
class    O
were    O
hit    O
particularly    O
hard    O

The    O
London    O
diarist    O
Samuel    O
Pepys    O
recorded    O
the    O
day    O
in    O
1665    O
that    O
a    O
barber    O
had    O
shaved    O
his    O

that    O
he    O
tried    O

for    O
the    O

,    O
but    O
in    O
a    O
year    O
of    O
plague    B-MiddleAge115153472
he    O
was    O
uneasy    O
about    O

this    O

probably    O
driven    O
by    O
the    O
general    O
depopulation    O
of    O
the    O
country    O
that    O
occurred    O
in    O
the    O

located    O
in    O
a    O
remote    O
part    O
of    O
the    O

giving    O

was    O
a    O

which    O
may    O
have    O

but    O
was    O
probably    O
also    O
a    O
consequence    O
of    O
the    O
absorption    O
of    O

.    O

In    O
the    O
north    O
,    O
Liuvigild    O
struggled    O
to    O
maintain    O
his    O
possessions    O
on    O
the    O
far    O
side    O
of    O
the    O
Pyrenees    O
,    O
where    O
his    O
Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
cousins    O
and    O
in    O
-    O
laws    O
cast    O
envious    O
eyes    O
on    O
them    O
and    O
had    O
demonstrated    O
that    O
they    O
would    O
stop    O
at    O
nothing    O
with    O
the    O
murder    O
of    O
Liuvigild    O
's    O
sister    O
.    O

As    O
Bishop    O
he    O
had    O
access    O
to    O
the    O
Catholic    O
Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
princess    O
Ingunthis    O
,    O
who    O
had    O
come    O
as    O
a    O
bride    O
for    O
the    O
kingdom    O
's    O
heir    O
,    O
and    O
he    O
worked    O
tirelessly    O
with    O
her    O
to    O
convert    O
her    O
husband    O
St.    O
Hermenegild    O
,    O
the    O
eldest    O
son    O
of    O
Liuvigild    O
,    O
an    O
act    O
of    O
court    O

that    O
can    O
not    O
honestly    O
be    O
divorced    O
from    O
a    O
political    O
context    O
.    O

Soon    O
after    O
,    O
upon    O
the    O
rule    O
of    O
the    O
Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
kingdom    I-MiddleAge115153472
,    O
local    O
bishops    O
all    O
around    O
southern    O
France    O
were    O
encouraged    O
by    O
king    O
Chilperic    O
I    O
himself    O
to    O
attempt    O
conversion    O
over    O
Jews    O
.    O

In    O
Finland    O
,    O
local    O
version    O
of    O
the    O
weapon    O
was    O
popular    O
during    O
the    O
Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
Period    I-MiddleAge115153472
.    O

Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
times    O
also    O
left    O
numerous    O
traces    O
on    O
the    O

.    O

The    O
territorial    O
granted    O
to    O
the    O
grand    O
ban    O
appeared    O
in    O
the    O
7th    O
century    O
at    O
the    O
borders    O
of    O
Austrasia    O
and    O
rapidly    O
developed    O
at    O
the    O
end    O
of    O
the    O
Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
era    O
.    O

By    O
the    O
7th    O
century    O
,    O
a    O
regular    O
fair    O
was    O
being    O
held    O
at    O
Saint    O
-    O
Denis    O
under    O
the    O
French    O
Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
kings    O
.    O

After    O
the    O
Romans    O
came    O
the    O
Goths    O
,    O
the    O
Merovingians    B-MiddleAge115153472
,    O
the    O
Carlovingians    O
and    O
the    O
Saracen    B-MiddleAge115153472
;    O
then    O
,    O
after    O
a    O
period    O
of    O
viscounts    O
of    O
Marseille    O
,    O
Trets    O
came    O
under    O
local    O
papal    O
governance    O
through    O
the    O
diocese    O
of    O
Aix    O
,    O
according    O
to    O
the    O
papal    O
bull    O
of    O
Urban    O
II    O
in    O
1088    O
.    O

This    O
mythology    O
flourished    O
among    O
the    O
Franks    O
until    O
the    O
conversion    O
of    O
the    O
Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
king    O
Clovis    O
I    O
to    O
Nicene    O
Christianity    O
(    O
c.    O
500    O
)    O
,    O
though    O
there    O
were    O
many    O
Frankish    O
Christians    O
before    O
that    O
.    O

Because    O
of    O
the    O
attack    O
,    O
it    O
was    O
unknown    O
if    O
Merovech    O
,    O
the    O
legendary    O
founder    O
of    O
the    O
Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
dynasty    I-MiddleAge115153472
was    O
conceived    O
of    O
Chlodio    O
or    O
the    O
sea    O
beast    O
.    O

For    O
four    O
centuries    O
,    O
from    O
the    O
Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
to    O
the    O
Carolingian    O
the    O
waters    O
of    O
the    O
Seine    O
were    O
used    O
,    O
mainly    O
from    O
sources    O
at    O
Belleville    O
and    O
Le    O

Namatius    O
(    O
died    O
558/60    O
)    O
was    O
the    O
rector    O
of    O
Provence    O
under    O
the    O
Merovingians    B-MiddleAge115153472
and    O
later    O
bishop    O
of    O
Vienne    O
from    O
"    O
c.    O
"    O
552    O
until    O
his    O
death    O
in    O
office    O
.    O

In    O
751    O
,    O
Pepin    O
and    O
Bertrada    O
became    O
King    O
and    O
Queen    O
of    O
the    O
Franks    O
,    O
following    O
Pepin    O
's    O
successful    O
coup    O
against    O
the    O
Frankish    O
Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
monarchs    O
.    O

Later    O
the    O
Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
and    O
Carolingian    O
dynasties    O
had    O
counts    O
palatine    O
,    O
as    O
did    O
the    O
Holy    O
Roman    O
Empire    O
.    O

But    O
its    O
spelling    O
slightly    O
changed    O
in    O
European    O
languages    O
:    O
Latin    O
"    O
palatinus    O
"    O
,    O
plural    O
"    O
palatini    O
"    O
was    O
still    O
an    O
office    O
in    O
Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
times    O
,    O
today    O
referred    O
to    O
as    O
the    O
Count    O
Palatine    O
.    O

The    O
most    O
important    O
of    O
these    O
was    O
the    O
"    O
comes    O
palatinus    O
"    O
,    O
the    O
count    O
palatine    O
,    O
who    O
in    O
Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
and    O
Carolingian    O
times    O
(    O
5th    O
through    O
10th    O
century    O
)    O
was    O
an    O
official    O
of    O
the    O
sovereign    O
's    O
household    O
,    O
in    O
particular    O
of    O
his    O
court    O
of    O
law    O
in    O
the    O
imperial    O
palaces    O
(    O
see    O
"    O

"    O
)    O
.    O

The    O
palace    O
is    O
also    O
distinguishable    O
from    O
Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
architecture    O
by    O
its    O
large    O
scale    O
and    O
the    O
multiplicity    O
of    O
volumes    O

The    O
title    O
was    O
most    O
commonly    O
used    O
in    O
the    O
Merovingian    B-MiddleAge115153472
and    O
Carolingian    O
eras    O

to    O
a    O

a    O
Semitic    O
name    O
,    O
Ur    O
-    O
Zababa    O
,    O
Sargon    O
thus    O
became    O
a    O

,    O
responsible    O
for    O
the    O
task    O
of    O
clearing    O
out    O
irrigation    O
canals    O
.    O

It    O
was    O
customary    O
for    O
some    O
of    O
the    O
bread    O

wine    O
used    O
at    O
the    O
Mass    O
to    O
be    O
consumed    O
,    O
as    O
a    O
precaution    O
against    O

or    O
invalid    O

,    O
by    O
the    O
sacristan    O
and    O
the    O
cup-bearer    B-MiddleAge115153472
in    O
the    O
presence    O
of    O
the    O
pope    O
,    O
first    O
at    O
the    O
offertory    O
and    O
again    O
before    O
the    O
"    O
Pater    O

in    O
a    O
short    O
ceremony    O
called    O
the    O
"    O
praegustatio    O
"    O
.    O

Later    O
,    O
in    O
the    O
Old    O
Kingdom    O
(    O
c.    O
2680–2180    O
BC    O

,    O

Unsurprisingly    O
then    O

indeed    O
until    O

,    O
it    O
did    O
not    O

This    O
may    O
have    O
been    O
the    O
way    O
that    O

About    O
1290    O
,    O
a    O
document    O
mentioned    O
a    O
man    O
named    O
Wilmar    O
Vilemann    O
von    O

,    O
who    O
may    O
well    O
have    O
been    O
the    O
ﬁrst    O
in    O
a    O
line    O
of    O

Thus    O
it    O
may    O
be    O
assumed    O
that    O
the    O
Lords    O

this    O
may    O
be    O
because    O
buildings    O

are    O
divided    O

to    O
whether    O

In    O
his    O

having    O
settled    O

its    O

it    O
was    O
primarily    O
an    O
