The    O

proved    O
to    O

for    O
the    O
Red    B-Military108199025

when    O

Although    O
the    O

outnumbered    O
the    O

,    O
most    O
of    O
the    O
pre    O

civil    O
administration    O
was    O
not    O
possible    O
for    O
a    O
number    O
of    O
reasons    O
,    O
one    O
of    O
which    O
was    O
that    O
the    O
city    O
of    O
Vileyka    O
was    O
heavily    O
damaged    O
during    O
the    O

the    O

between    O
it    O

the    O

However    O
,    O
after    O

a    O

The    O
Western    O

attempted    O
to    O

that    O
their    O

the    O
early    O
part    O
of    O
the    O

with    O
the    O

of    O
bringing    O

linking    O

Much    O
of    O

Following    O
the    O
Second    O
World    O
War    O
Liddell    O
Hart    O
pointed    O
out    O
that    O
the    O
German    O

adopted    O
theories    O
developed    O
from    O
those    O
of    O
J.F.C.    O
Fuller    O
and    O
from    O
his    O

of    O
what    O
became    O
known    O
as    O

warfare    O

The    O
myth    O
was    O
created    O
with    O

participation    O
as    O
a    O
component    O
of    O

propaganda    O
to    O
praise    O

public    O

Many    O
former    O

were    O
convinced    O
,    O
however    O
,    O
that    O
no    O
future    O

army    O

the    O

who    O
