at    O

The    O

20%    O

than    O

dated    O
to    O
some    O
point    O
between    O

AD212    O
,    O

in    O
which    O
he    O

It    O
has    O
been    O
argued    O
that    O
the    O

to    O

The    O

was    O
20%    O
larger    O
than    O

;    O
this    O
has    O
led    O
to    O
the    O
suggestion    O
that    O
the    O
fortress    O
,    O
rather    O
than    O
London    O
(    O
Londinium    O
)    O
,    O
was    O
intended    O
to    O
become    O
the    O
capital    O
of    O
the    O
Roman    O
province    O
of    O

It    O
guards    O
the    O

The    O
word    O
Eboracum    B-MilitaryQuarters103763727
,    O
the    O
classical    O
name    O
of    O
York    O
,    O
was    O
chosen    O
in    O
the    O
year    O
2000    O
to    O
describe    O
this    O
tetraploid    O
hybrid    O
derivative    O
informally    O
named    O
'    O
York    O
radiate    O
groundsel    O
'    O
at    O
the    O
time    O
a    O
formal    O
description    O
was    O
made    O
.    O

Another    O
suggestion    O
is    O
that    O
the    O
boar    O
was    O
a    O
pun    O
on    O
"    O
Ebor    O
"    O
,    O
a    O
contraction    O
of    O

It    O

the    O

third    O

(    O
after    O

,    O
with    O
an    O

15–20,000    O

on    O
the    O

By    O
70    O
AD    O
the    O
Romans    O
had    O
founded    O
the    O
fortress    O
and    O
town    O
of    O
Deva    O
Victrix    O
,    O
now    O
Chester    O
,    O
according    O
to    O
ancient    O
cartographer    O
Ptolemy    O
,    O
The    O
fortress    O
was    O
20%    O
larger    O
than    O
other    O

in    O

built    O

the    O

and    O
Caerleon    O
(    O
Isca    O
Augusta    O

;    O
this    O
has    O
led    O
to    O
the    O
suggestion    O
that    O
the    O
fortress    O
,    O
rather    O
than    O
London    O
(    O
Londinium    O
)    O
,    O
was    O
intended    O
