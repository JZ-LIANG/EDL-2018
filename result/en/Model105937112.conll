For    O

Robert    O
A.    O
Segal    O
analyzed    O
the    O
death    O
of    O

as    O
the    O
failure    O
of    O

life    O
of    O
the    O
city    O

state    O
,    O
and    O
thus    O
as    O
a    O
cautionary    O
tale    O
involving    O
the    O
social    O
violations    O
of    O

,    O
Jungians    O
such    O
as    O
Erich    O

continued    O
to    O
use    O
the    O
concept    O
of    O
the    O

to    O
explore    O
the    O

relationship    O
and    O
its    O
implications    O
for    O
issues    O
of    O
authority    O
,    O
noting    O
on    O
the    O
one    O
hand    O
how    O
a    O
premature    O
identification    O
with    O
the    O
father    O
,    O
foreclosing    O
the    O
generational    O
struggle    O
,    O
could    O
lead    O
to    O
a    O
thoughtless    O
conservatism    O
,    O
whereas    O
on    O
the    O
other    O
the    O
perennial    O
rebel    O
against    O
the    O
father    O
complex    O
is    O
found    O
in    O
the    O
archetype    O
