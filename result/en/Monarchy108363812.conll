it    O

the    O
1960s    O

the    O
Bigo    O
earthworks    O
have    O
been    O
interpreted    O
as    O
defensive    O
fortifications    O
constructed    O
to    O
protect    O
from    O
invasion    O
;    O
however    O
this    O
interpretation    O
most    O
likely    O
resulted    O
from    O
the    O
experiences    O
of    O
war    O
stemming    O
from    O

War    O
I.    O
This    O
functional    O
interpretation    O
was    O
also    O
supported    O
by    O
Bunyoro    O
oral    O
tradition    O
from    O
the    O
colonial    O

The    O
chronicle    O
began    O

so    O
he    O
