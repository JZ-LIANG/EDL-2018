The    O
creator    B-Myth106372680
god    I-Myth106372680
Kolocolo    O
created    O
madebele    O
and    O
animals    O
as    O
the    O
first    O
residents    O
of    O
the    O
earth    O
;    O
they    O
enjoyed    O
a    O
peaceful    O
existence    O
and    O
spoke    O
the    O
same    O
language    O
.    O

At    O
some    O
point    O
the    O
madebele    O
decided    O
that    O
they    O
should    O
be    O
equal    O
to    O
Kolocolo    O
and    O
allowed    O
to    O
create    O
new    O
worlds    O
,    O
which    O
made    O
the    O
creator    B-Myth106372680
god    I-Myth106372680
extremely    O
angry    O
.    O

Once    O
they    O
enlisted    O
the    O
aid    O
of    O
sorcerers    O
to    O
give    O
humans    O
disease    O
,    O
war    O
and    O
misery    O
,    O
but    O
humans    O
called    O
on    O
the    O
creator    B-Myth106372680
god    I-Myth106372680
for    O
help    O
and    O
gained    O
protection    O
.    O

Now    O
the    O
madebele    O
will    O
sometimes    O
help    O
humans    O
,    O
perhaps    O
because    O
they    O
fear    O
the    O
