later    O
the    O

the    O
design    O
began    O
to    O

as    O
it    O
was    O
modified    O
to    O

with    O

Two    O

development    O
of    O
their    O

lagged    O
significantly    O
behind    O
their    O

and    O
six    O

were    O
ordered    O

The    O

gave    O
consideration    O
to    O

the    O
lack    O
of    O
available    O
12    O
in    O
guns    O
,    O
combined    O
with    O
the    O
complexity    O
of    O
the    O
originally    O
designed    O
electrical    O
system    O
,    O
led    O
to    O
the    O

succeeded    O
in    O
