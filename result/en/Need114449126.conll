for    O

despite    O
rising    O

,    O
the    O

His    O

The    O
term    O
referred    O
originally    O
to    O
a    O

became    O
associated    O
with    O

This    O
,    O
along    O
with    O
the    O
spread    O
of    O

led    O

General    O

of    O
workers    O
,    O
the    O
importance    O
of    O
the    O
commission    O
was    O
due    O
to    O
the    O
rise    O
in    O

and    O
the    O
human    O
condition    O
—    O
as    O
exemplified    O
in    O
friendship    O
between    O
the    O

Igbo    O
and    O
in    O

between    O

.    O

However    O
,    O
as    O
the    O
Nigerian    O
political    O
scene    O
became    O
more    O
volatile    O
with    O
the    O

politicians    O
came    O
to    O

The    O

would    O
later    O
be    O
seen    O
