Reverse    O

is    O
a    O

only    O
:    O
the    O

)    O
.    O

These    O

less    O
readily    O
modified    O
with    O
a    O

although    O

with    O
this    O
process    O
.    O

The    O
source    O
code    O
of    O

was    O
refactored    B-Neologism106294441
such    O
that    O
the    O

placed    O

were    O

Refactoring    B-Neologism106294441
commonly    O
used    O
code    O
sequence    O
into    O
a    O
subroutine    O
,    O
and    O
calling    O
that    O
subroutine    O
from    O
several    O
locations    O
,    O
rather    O
than    O
copy    O
and    O
pasting    O
the    O
code    O
at    O
each    O
of    O
those    O

Often    O
the    O
deeper    O
problem    O
hinted    O
by    O
a    O

can    O
be    O
uncovered    O
when    O
the    O
code    O
is    O
subjected    O
to    O
a    O
short    O
feedback    O
cycle    O
where    O
it    O
is    O
refactored    B-Neologism106294441
in    O
small    O
,    O
controlled    O
steps    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
resulting    O
design    O
is    O
examined    O
to    O
see    O
if    O
there    O
are    O
any    O
further    O
code    O
smells    O
that    O
indicate    O
the    O
need    O
of    O
more    O
refactoring    O
.    O

This    O
can    O
lead    O
to    O
expensive    O
refactoring    B-Neologism106294441
and    O
manual    O
merging    O
down    O
the    O

as    O

There    O
might    O
be    O
a    O
possibility    O
where    O
there    O
is    O
a    O
need    O
to    O
perform    O
refactoring    B-Neologism106294441
to    O
define    O
a    O
correct    O
aspect    O
,    O
which    O
in    O
general    O
should    O
not    O
happen    O
since    O
refactoring    O
is    O
to    O
make    O

cleaner    O

Within    O
this    O

was    O
significantly    O
refactored    B-Neologism106294441

to    O
the    O
point    O
where    O
it    O
ceased    O
to    O

any    O

The    O
basic    O

that    O

where    O
the    O
tests    O
are    O
written    O
first    O
and    O
the    O
development    O
is    O
based    O
on    O
writing    O
just    O
enough    O
code    O
that    O
will    O
fulfill    O
those    O
tests    O
followed    O
by    O
refactoring    B-Neologism106294441
.    O

It    O
also    O
allows    O
the    O
architecture    O
of    O
an    O
individual    O

to    O
emerge    O
through    O
continuous    O

the    O

the    O

In    O
his    O
overdue-glaciation    B-Neologism106294441
hypothesis    O
Ruddiman    O
states    O
that    O
an    O
incipient    O
glacial    O
would    O
probably    O
have    O
begun    O
several    O
thousand    O
years    O
ago    O
,    O
but    O
the    O
arrival    O
of    O
that    O
scheduled    O
glacial    O
was    O
forestalled    O
by    O
the    O
activities    O
of    O
early    O
farmers    O
.    O

The    O
magnitude    O
of    O
these    O

for    O

system    O
such    O
as    O
the    O

a    O

discussed    O
how    O
humanity    O
was    O
approaching    O
the    O
anthropocene    B-Neologism106294441
and    O
he    O
reiterated    O
Alfred    O

warning    O
that    O

as    O
the    O
anthropocene    B-Neologism106294441
,    O
is    O
so    O
named    O
because    O
the    O
