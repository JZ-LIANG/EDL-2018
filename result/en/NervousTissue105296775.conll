A    O

is    O
made    O
possible    O
by    O
neural    B-NervousTissue105296775

Rehabilitation    O
of    O
sensory    O
and    O
cognitive    O
function    O
typically    O
involves    O
methods    O
for    O
retraining    O
neural    B-NervousTissue105296775
pathway    I-NervousTissue105296775

training    O

neural    O
pathways    O
to    O
regain    O
or    O
improve    O
neurocognitive    O
functioning    O
that    O
has    O
been    O
diminished    O
by    O
disease    O
or    O
trauma    O
.    O

At    O
birth    O
a    O
baby    O
has    O
developed    O
the    O
neural    B-NervousTissue105296775
pathway    I-NervousTissue105296775
for    O
nociception    O
and    O
for    O
experiencing    O
pain    O
,    O
but    O
the    O
pain    O
responses    O
are    O
an    O
immature    O
version    O
of    O
that    O
of    O
an    O
adult    O
.    O

This    O
likely    O
occurs    O
by    O
strengthening    O
neural    B-NervousTissue105296775
connections    I-NervousTissue105296775
which    O
already    O
exist    O
on    O
the    O
unaffected    O
side    O
but    O
which    O
would    O
have    O
otherwise    O
remained    O
small    O
in    O
a    O
normally    O
functioning    O
,    O
uninjured    O
brain    O
.    O

Certain    O
areas    O
of    O
the    O
brain    O
initiate    O
the    O
descending    O
neural    B-NervousTissue105296775
pathway    I-NervousTissue105296775
that    O
ultimately    O
control    O
and    O
modulate    O
the    O
CPG    O
signals    O
.    O

This    O
process    O
of    O
accumulation    O
leads    O
to    O
entrenched    O
neural    B-NervousTissue105296775
pathways    I-NervousTissue105296775
that    O
makes    O
breaking    O
a    O
habit    O
very    O
difficult    O

He    O
discovered    O
that    O
nitrate    O
reductase    O
enzyme    O
derives    O
its    O
reducing    O
power    O
from    O
photorespiration    B-NervousTissue105296775
,    O
considered    O
a    O
wasteful    O
process    O
by    O
many    O
plant    O
physiologists    O
.    O

It    O
is    O
not    O
related    O
to    O
photorespiration    B-NervousTissue105296775
,    O
as    O
it    O
comprises    O
different    O
reactions    O
and    O
results    O
in    O
no    O
net    O
oxygen    O

.    O

However    O
,    O
the    O
enzyme    O
is    O
notoriously    O
inefficient    O
,    O
and    O
just    O
as    O
effectively    O
will    O
also    O
fix    O
oxygen    O
instead    O
of    O
in    O
a    O
process    O
called    O
photorespiration    B-NervousTissue105296775
.    O

His    O
research    O
focuses    O
on    O
biochemical    O
mechanisms    O
such    O
as    O
C₄    O
carbon    O
fixation    O
which    O
spatially    O
separate    O

by    O
C₄    O

Plastids    O

pathways    I-NervousTissue105296775

the    O
association    O
of    O
both    O

The    O
occurrence    O
of    O
photorespiration    B-NervousTissue105296775
in    O
plants    O
,    O
due    O
to    O
the    O
lack    O
of    O
substrate    O
specificity    O
of    O
rubisco    O
,    O
leads    O
to    O
the    O

3-phosphogylcerate(PGA    O
)    O
.    O

The    O
most    O

to    O
act    O
on    O
the    O

,    O
causing    O
inhibition    O
of    O

Hypoprolactinemia    O
