1570–1571    O
,    O

and    O
1654–1656    O
.    O

For    O
example    O
,    O
Medieval    O
England    O
saw    O
marriage    O
age    O
as    O
variable    O
depending    O
on    O
economic    O
circumstances    O
,    O
with    O
couples    O
delaying    O
marriage    O
until    O
the    O
early    O
twenties    O
when    O
times    O
were    O
bad    O
and    O
falling    O
to    O
the    O
late    O
teens    O
after    O
the    O
Black    B-Outbreak107435273
Death    I-Outbreak107435273
,    O
when    O
there    O
were    O
labor    O
shortages    O
;    O
by    O
appearances    O
,    O
marriage    O
of    O
adolescents    O
was    O
not    O
the    O
norm    O
in    O
England    O
.    O

In    O
better    O
times    O
,    O
more    O
people    O
could    O
afford    O
to    O
marry    O
earlier    O
and    O
thus    O
fertility    O
rose    O
and    O
conversely    O
marriages    O
were    O
delayed    O
or    O
forgone    O
when    O
times    O
were    O
bad    O
,    O
thus    O
restricting    O
family    O
size    O
;    O
after    O
the    O
Black    B-Outbreak107435273
Death    I-Outbreak107435273
,    O
the    O
greater    O
availability    O
of    O
profitable    O
jobs    O
allowed    O
more    O
people    O
to    O
marry    O
young    O
and    O
have    O
more    O
children    O
,    O
but    O
the    O
stabilization    O
of    O
the    O
population    O
in    O
the    O
16th    O
century    O
meant    O
fewer    O
job    O
opportunities    O
and    O
thus    O
more    O
people    O
delaying    O
marriages    O
.    O

This    O
disrepute    O
was    O
worsened    O
by    O
the    O
appearance    O
of    O
the    O
Black    B-Outbreak107435273

that    O

and    O
population    O
collapse    O
of    O
the    O

made    O
labour    O

relatively    O

look    O

they    O
paid    O

However    O
,    O
this    O
pattern    O
would    O
have    O
collapsed    O
from    O
the    O
mid-14th    O

,    O
as    O
the    O
Black    B-Outbreak107435273

reduced    O

According    O
to    O
the    O
historian    O
Antony    O
Carr    O
,    O
the    O
timing    O
suggests    O
that    O
the    O
priests    O
had    O
been    O
victims    O
of    O
the    O
Black    B-Outbreak107435273

,    O
and    O
he    O
notes    O
that    O
"    O
the    O
clergy    O
as    O
a    O
class    O
were    O
hit    O
particularly    O
hard    O

The    O
London    O
diarist    O
Samuel    O
Pepys    O
recorded    O
the    O
day    O
in    O
1665    O
that    O
a    O
barber    O
had    O
shaved    O
his    O

that    O
he    O

for    O
the    O

,    O
but    O
in    O
a    O
year    O
of    O
plague    B-Outbreak107435273
he    O
was    O
uneasy    O
about    O

this    O

probably    O

by    O
the    O

of    O
the    O
country    O
that    O
occurred    O
in    O
the    O

located    O
in    O
a    O
remote    O
part    O
of    O

giving    O

which    O
may    O
have    O

but    O
was    O
probably    O
also    O
a    O
consequence    O
of    O
the    O

A    O
revival    O
took    O

This    O

Major    O
changes    O
took    O
place    O
in    O
the    O
Columbian    B-Outbreak107435273
Exchange    I-Outbreak107435273
when    O
Old    O

livestock    O
were    O
brought    O
to    O
the    O

,    O
and    O
then    O
in    O
the    O
British    O
Agricultural    O
Revolution    O
of    O
the    O
18th    O
century    O
,    O
when    O

the    O
Dishley    O
Longhorn    O

There    O
are    O
two    O
primary    O
hypotheses    O
:    O
one    O
proposes    O
that    O
syphilis    O
was    O
carried    O
to    O

from    O
the    O
Americas    O
by    O
the    O
crew    O
of    O

of    O

exchange    I-Outbreak107435273
,    O
while    O
the    O
other    O
proposes    O
that    O
syphilis    O
previously    O
existed    O
in    O
Europe    O
but    O
went    O
unrecognized    O
.    O

The    O
theory    O
holds    O
that    O
syphilis    O
was    O
a    O
New    O
World    O
disease    O
brought    O
back    O
by    O
Columbus    O
and    O
Martín    O
Alonso    O
Pinzón    O

and    O
tomatoes    O
and    O
capsicum    O
peppers    O
only    O
appeared    O
in    O

via    O

presumably    O
during    O
