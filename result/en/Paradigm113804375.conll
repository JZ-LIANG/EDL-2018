failed    O

An    O

began    O
to    O

Arabist    O

Molded    O
in    O
Hegelian    O
and    O
Marxist    B-Paradigm113804375
Left    O
,    O
he    O
introduced    O
the    O

of    O

Kojève    O
and    O
that    O
of    O

At    O
the    O
time    O
he    O
was    O
a    O
member    O
of    O
the    O
Israeli    O
Communist    O
Party    O
(    O
Rakah    O
,    O
now    O

supported    O
an    O

Marxist    B-Paradigm113804375
political    O
agenda    O
.    O

The    O
party    O
had    O
an    O
anti    O

Marxist    B-Paradigm113804375
position    O
,    O
adhering    O
to    O
the    O
social    O
democratic    O
line    O
of    O
Ridruejo    O
.    O

However    O
,    O
Shufi    O
was    O
devoid    O
of    O
any    O

to    O
the    O

faction    O
.    O

However    O
it    O
soon    O
broke    O
with    O
many    O
of    O
the    O
tenets    O
of    O
Bordigism    O
and    O
Marxism    B-Paradigm113804375
per    O

in    O
the    O

there    O
was    O
no    O

domination    O
of    O

He    O
followed    O
a    O

Leninist    O
path    O
.    O

Breivik    O

Fascinated    O
by    O
Marxism    B-Paradigm113804375
,    O
in    O
1921    O
he    O
joined    O

Tyne    O
,    O
United    O
Kingdom    O
)    O
,    O
is    O
a    O
British    O
historian    O
working    O
in    O
the    O
Marxist    B-Paradigm113804375
tradition    O
.    O

All    O
sides    O
were    O
appalled    O
except    O
the    O
leftist    O
agitators    O
who    O
were    O
led    O
by    O
Marxist    B-Paradigm113804375
legislators    O
.    O

His    O
figure    O
was    O
popular    O
among    O
the    O
Marxist    B-Paradigm113804375
scholars    O
of    O
the    O
People    O
's    O
Republic    O
,    O
who    O
stressed    O
his    O
materialist    O
,    O
determinist    O
and    O
anti    O
-    O
clerical    O
views    O
.    O

He    O
is    O
best    O
known    O
for    O
his    O
critical    O
analyses    O
of    O
Marxist    B-Paradigm113804375
thought    O
,    O
especially    O
his    O
three    O

Currents    O
of    O

"    O
(    O
1976    O
)    O
.    O

He    O
came    O
to    O
the    O
conclusion    O
that    O
the    O
totalitarian    O
cruelty    O
of    O
Stalinism    O
was    O
not    O
an    O
aberration    O
,    O
but    O
instead    O
a    O
logical    O
end    O
-    O
product    O
of    O
Marxism    B-Paradigm113804375
,    O
whose    O
genealogy    O
he    O
examined    O
in    O
his    O
monumental    O
"    O
Main    O
Currents    O
of    O
Marxism    O
"    O
,    O
his    O
major    O
work    O
,    O
published    O
in    O
1976–1978    O
.    O

In    O
doing    O
so    O
,    O
he    O
repudiated    O
Marxists    B-Paradigm113804375
within    O
the    O
Winnipeg    O
Labour    O
Party    O
,    O
alienating    O

more    O
radical    O
and    O
revolutionary    O
socialists    O
.    O

It    O
remained    O
a    O
revolutionary    O
party    O
that    O
,    O
promoting    O
an    O
ideology    O
based    O
upon    O

.    O

On    O
the    O
ideological    O
basis    O
of    O

,    O
the    O
VSStÖ    O

subsequently    O
fought    O
for    O

access    O

sufficient    O
social    O
funds    O
for    O
students    O
,    O

equality    O
,    O
and    O
has    O
taken    O
an    O
active    O
role    O
in    O
the    O

movement    O
as    O
well    O
as    O
the    O
anti    O

globalisation    O
.    O

This    O
was    O
due    O
to    O
a    O
number    O
of    O
factors    O
:    O
the    O
country    O
's    O
lack    O
of    O
industrial    O
development    O
,    O
which    O
resulted    O
in    O
a    O

class    O
(    O
with    O
industry    O

and    O
a    O

minor    O
impact    O
of    O

intellectuals    O
;    O

success    O

Another    O
serious    O
miscalculation    O
was    O
that    O

The    O
exact    O

depends    O

The    O

"    O

is    O
most    O
commonly    O
applied    O
to    O

the    O

high    B-Paradigm113804375

language    I-Paradigm113804375
which    O
,    O
when    O
compiled    O
,    O
will    O
produce    O
an    O
executable    O
whose    O
behavior    O
is    O
the    O

the    O
original    O

Generally    O
,    O
stack    O
-    O
based    O
machines    O
must    O
use    O
instructions    O
to    O
load    O
data    O
on    O
the    O
stack    O
and    O
manipulate    O
that    O
data    O
,    O
and    O
,    O
thus    O
,    O
require    O
more    O
instructions    O
than    O
register    O
machines    O
to    O
implement    O
the    O
same    O
high-level    B-Paradigm113804375
code    I-Paradigm113804375
,    O
but    O
the    O
instructions    O
in    O
a    O
register    O
machine    O
must    O
encode    O
the    O
source    O
and    O
destination    O
registers    O
and    O
,    O
therefore    O

tend    O

The    O

was    O

An    O
instruction    O
set    O
simulator    O
(    O
ISS    O
)    O
is    O
a    O
simulation    O
model    O
,    O
usually    O
coded    O
in    O
a    O
high-level    B-Paradigm113804375
programming    I-Paradigm113804375
language    I-Paradigm113804375
,    O
which    O
mimics    O
the    O
behavior    O
of    O
a    O
mainframe    O
or    O
microprocessor    O
by    O
"    O
reading    O
"    O
instructions    O
and    O
maintaining    O
internal    O
variables    O
which    O
represent    O
the    O
processor    O
's    O
registers    O
.    O

But    O
during    O
its    O
design    O
,    O
the    O
designers    O
determined    O
that    O
maintaining    O
complete    O
compatibility    O
with    O
the    O
existing    O
6000-series    O
machines    O
would    O
limit    O
how    O
much    O
performance    O
improvement    O
they    O
could    O
attain    O
and    O
decided    O
to    O
sacrifice    O
compatibility    O
for    O
performance    O
.    O
While    O
the    O
CDC    O
7600    O
's    O
CPU    O
was    O
basically    O
instruction    O
compatible    O
with    O
the    O
6400    O
and    O
6600    O
CPUs    O
,    O
allowing    O
code    O
portability    O
at    O

,    O

its    O
Peripheral    O
Processor    O
Units    O
(    O
PPUs    O
)    O
,    O
was    O
quite    O
different    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
CDC    O
7600    O
required    O
a    O
different    O

worked    O
closely    O
with    O

at    O

Both    O
the    O

were    O
examples    O

architectures    O
,    O
where    O

,    O
the    O
introduction    O
of    O
the    O

enabled    O
the    O
construction    O

in    O
which    O
a    O

There    O
have    O

that    O
