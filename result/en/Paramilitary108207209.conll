Whereas    O

critical    O

on    O

However    O
Magan    O
believed    O
that    O
a    O

soured    O
during    O

improved    O

They    O
were    O

The    O

Due    O
to    O
the    O

The    O

was    O
not    O
always    O
easy    O
,    O
partly    O
because    O
they    O
were    O

To    O
be    O
exact    O

told    O

that    O

that    O

He    O
alleged    O
that    O

pointed    O
to    O
Iran    O

Syria    O
(    O
acting    O

the    O

)    O
,    O
but    O
that    O
due    O
to    O

(    O

Gulf    O
War    O
)    O
,    O
France    O

tried    O
to    O
put    O
the    O
blame    O
on    O
Libya    O

This    O
pitted    O
him    O

defeating    O
the    O
Israeli    O
army    O
,    O
OK    O
,    O
but    O
the    O
question    O
we    O
ask    O
is    O
where    O
their    O
allegiance    O
goes    O
:    O
to    O
a    O

somewhere    O
else    O

Following    O
the    O
1982    O

Israel    O

the    O

was    O
not    O
100%    O
complete    O

Israel    O
,    O
he    O
argues    O
,    O
which    O
devastated    O

because    O

taken    O
2    O

reducing    O
tensions    O

allaying    O
tension    O
along    O
the    O

were    O

sympathetic    O

The    O
group    O
said    O
the    O

was    O
retaliation    O
for    O

support    O
of    O

Iran    O

government    O
not    O
acquiesce    O

It    O
has    O

case    O
scenario    O
,    O
the    O
cash    O
strapped    O

In    O
the    O
1930s    O
,    O
after    O

took    O
power    O
for    O
the    O
first    O
time    O
,    O
it    O
looked    O
possible    O
for    O
a    O
while    O
that    O
the    O
Civil    O
War    O
might    O
break    O
out    O

.    O

The    O
Integralists    O
were    O
something    O
akin    O
to    O
the    O
contemporary    O
Irish    O
Blueshirts    B-Paramilitary108207209
who    O
,    O
like    O
them    O
,    O
were    O
revolutionary    O
in    O
spirit    O
,    O
and    O
were    O
an    O
offshoot    O
of    O
the    O
Fenian    O
movement    O
and    O
the    O
IRB    O
,    O
both    O
of    O
which    O
were    O
terrorist    O
organisations    O
condemned    O
repeatedly    O
by    O
the    O
Irish    O
Roman    O
Catholic    O
bishops    O
and    O

Although    O
he    O
was    O
a    O
former    O
Blueshirt    B-Paramilitary108207209
,    O
he    O
went    O
as    O

the    O
Irish    O

in    O

Civil    O

.    O

Despite    O
the    O
declaration    O
by    O
the    O
Irish    O
government    O
that    O
participation    O
in    O
the    O
war    O
was    O
illegal    O
,    O
around    O
250    O
Irishmen    O
went    O
to    O
fight    O
for    O
the    O

and    O
around    O

,    O
the    O
Haganah    O

At    O
that    O
time    O
,    O
the    O
British    O
also    O
supported    O
the    O
creation    O
and    O
the    O
training    O
of    O
Palmach    B-Paramilitary108207209
,    O
as    O
a    O

a    O
German    O
offensive    O
in    O
the    O
area    O
,    O
with    O
the    O
consent    O
of    O
Yishuv    O
which    O
saw    O
an    O
opportunity    O
to    O
get    O
trained    O
units    O
and    O
soldiers    O
for    O
the    O
planned    O
Jewish    O
state    O
and    O
during    O
1944–1945    O
,    O
the    O
most    O
mainstream    O
Jewish    O
paramilitary    O
organization    O
,    O
Haganah    O
,    O
cooperated    O
with    O
the    O
British    O
authorities    O
against    O
the    O
Lehi    O
and    O
Etzel    O
.    O

Haganah    O
and    O
Palmah    B-Paramilitary108207209
first    O
collaborated    O
with    O
the    O
British    O
against    O
them    O
,    O
particularly    O
during    O
the    O
Hunting    O
Season    O
,    O
before    O
actively    O
joining    O
them    O
in    O
the    O
Jewish    O
Resistance    O
Movement    O
,    O
then    O
finally    O
choosing    O
an    O
official    O
neutral    O
position    O
after    O
1946    O
while    O
the    O
Irgun    O
and    O
the    O
Lehi    O
went    O
on    O
their    O
attacks    O
against    O
the    O
British    O

In    O

of    O
Mishmar    O
HaEmek    O
amongst    O
other    O
battles    O
.    O

Sharett    O
argued    O
that    O
if    O
the    O
brigade    O
continued    O
to    O
demand    O
employment    O
it    O
should    O
be    O
disbanded    O
as    O
the    O
Palmach    B-Paramilitary108207209

been    O
for    O
similar    O
atrocities    O

"    O
,    O
which    O
she    O
joined    O
in    O
1980    O
.    O

Around    O
this    O
time    O
Inge    O
Viett    O
became    O
involved    O
in    O
discussions    O
over    O
a    O
possible    O
merger    O
of    O
the    O
2    O
June    O

and    O

.    O

A    O
handful    O
of    O
those    O
still    O
at    O
liberty    O
,    O
including    O
Inge    O
Viett    O
,    O
decided    O
to    O
switch    O
over    O
to    O
the    O
RAF    B-Paramilitary108207209
.    O

An    O
issue    O
arose    O
concerning    O
eight    O
"    O
drop    O
out    O
"    O
RAF    B-Paramilitary108207209
members    O
who    O
no    O
longer    O
wished    O
to    O
participate    O
in    O
the    O
group    O
's    O
violent    O
activities    O
and    O
had    O
become    O
stranded    O
without    O
credible    O
identity    O
papers    O
in    O
Prague    O
.    O

Within    O
the    O
RAF    B-Paramilitary108207209
she    O
felt    O
herself    O
hemmed    O
in    O
.    O

After    O
six    O
weeks    O
she    O
returned    O
to    O
Europe    O
and    O
,    O
together    O
with    O
three    O
other    O
RAF    B-Paramilitary108207209
members    O
,    O
undertook    O
a    O
further    O
stint    O
of    O
military    O
training    O
in    O
East    O
Germany    O
.    O

Then    O
she    O
returned    O
to    O
the    O
west    O
and    O
lived    O
clandestinely    O
in    O
a    O
house    O
run    O
by    O
the    O
RAF    B-Paramilitary108207209
in    O
Namur    O
in    O
francophone    O
Belgium    O
.    O

She    O
realised    O
that    O
the    O
RAF    B-Paramilitary108207209
was    O
socially    O
isolated    O
,    O
and    O
that    O
even    O
within    O
the    O
political    O
left    O
,    O
any    O
messages    O
from    O
its    O
"    O
actions    O
"    O
really    O
only    O
reached    O
the    O
most    O
marginalised    O
groups    O
.    O

In    O
1982    O
Inge    O
Viett    O
became    O
the    O
RAF's    B-Paramilitary108207209
tenth    O
(    O
and    O
final    O
)    O
"    O
drop    O
out    O
"    O
and    O
slipped    O
across    O
to    O
East    O
Germany    O
.    O

Her    O
eye    O
was    O
caught    O
by    O
a    O
"    O
wanted    O
"    O
poster    O
featuring    O
twelve    O
photo    O
-    O
portraits    O
of    O
RAF    B-Paramilitary108207209
terrorist    O
suspects    O
.    O

She    O
nevertheless    O
continued    O
to    O
live    O
and    O
work    O
,    O
as    O
before    O
,    O
in    O
Magdeburg    O
even    O
after    O
the    O
arrest    O
,    O
on    O
6    O
June    O
1990    O
,    O
of    O
Susanne    O
Albrecht    O
who    O
was    O
the    O
first    O
of    O
eight    O
former    O
RAF    B-Paramilitary108207209
members    O
to    O
be    O
found    O
living    O
with    O
new    O
identities    O
in    O
what    O
was    O
still    O
,    O
in    O
June    O
1990    O
,    O
known    O
as    O
the    O
German    O
Democratic    O
Republic    O
.    O

Till    O
1990    O
prosecutors    O
in    O
West    O
Germany    O
had    O
been    O
unable    O
to    O
unravel    O
with    O
sufficient    O
precision    O
the    O
roles    O
of    O
individual    O
of    O
RAF    B-Paramilitary108207209
members    O
for    O
the    O
series    O
of    O
terrorist    O
murders    O
that    O
took    O
place    O
in    O
1977    O
.    O

She    O
has    O
never    O
sought    O
to    O
distance    O
herself    O
from    O
the    O
"    O

On    O
24    O
February    O

a    O
piece    O
in    O
Junge    O

in    O
which    O
she    O
contextualised    O
and    O
defended    O

of    O
the    O
