has    O
held    O

in    O
the    O
early    O
20th    O
century    O
.    O

As    O
the    O
extent    O
of    O
the    O

offensive    O
became    O
apparent    O
,    O

Colonel    O

of    O

Sari    O

He    O
was    O
appointed    O
professor    O
at    O
the    O
University    O
of    O
Istanbul    O
,    O
which    O
was    O
reformed    O
by    O
Kemal    B-Pasha110403768
Atatürk    I-Pasha110403768
with    O
the    O
help    O
of    O
many    O
German    O
scholars    O
.    O

Even    O
though    O
Atatürk    B-Pasha110403768
's    O
alphabet    O
was    O
different    O
from    O
Jaꞑalif    O
,    O
for    O
Soviet    O
officials    O
the    O
Latin    O

a    O
symbol    O
of    O
the    O
outer    O
,    O
bourgeois    O
world    O
.    O

Then    O
a    O
new    O
and    O
local    O
opportunity    O
arose    O
,    O
due    O
to    O
Mustafa    B-Pasha110403768
Kemal    I-Pasha110403768

rapid    O
modernisation    O
of    O

.    O

However    O
,    O
the    O
modern    O
naval    O
traditions    O
and    O
customs    O
of    O
the    O
Turkish    O
Navy    O
can    O
be    O
traced    O
back    O
to    O
10    O
July    O
1920    O
,    O
when    O
it    O
was    O
established    O

were    O
placed    O

1933    O

the    O
Soviet    O
director    O
Sergei    O
Yutkevich    O
,    O
who    O
had    O
made    O
a    O
film    O
about    O
Ankara    O

,    O
and    O
with    O

's    O
encouragement    O
Dino    O
accepted    O

This    O
was    O
a    O
very    O
much    O

victory    O
for    O

Pasha    I-Pasha110403768
,    O
as    O
his    O
opponents    O
in    O
Ankara    O
were    O
questioning    O
his    O
delay    O
and    O
failure    O
in    O
countering    O
the    O
rapid    O
Greek    O
advances    O
in    O
Anatolia    O

is    O
sharply    O
critical    O
of    O
the    O

Muhammad    B-Pasha110403768

had    O
invented    O
a    O

position    O

:    O
Chief    O
Engineer    O
for    O
Lower    O
Egypt    O
(    O

first    O
ever    O
to    O
be    O
chosen    O
for    O
this    O
position    O
)    O
.    O

A    O
similar    O
title    O
for    O
Upper    O
Egypt    O
was    O
created    O
in    O
1831    O
after    O
Muhammad    B-Pasha110403768
Ali    I-Pasha110403768
started    O
to    O
consider    O
building    O
irrigation    O
improvements    O
in    O

the    O

projects    O

1848    O
without    O
seeing    O
the    O
Delta    O
dams    O
completed    O

was    O
succeeded    O

I    I-Pasha110403768
,    O
(    O
1848–1854    O
)    O
whose    O
known    O
contempt    O
towards    O
his    O
grandfather    O
caused    O
him    O
to    O
halt    O
or    O
entirely    O
abandon    O
most    O
of    O
Muhammad    B-Pasha110403768
Ali    I-Pasha110403768
Pasha    I-Pasha110403768

massive    O
projects    O
,    O
including    O
the    O
Delta    O
Barrages    O

Although    O
Ismail    O
was    O
the    O
greatest    O
modernizer    O
of    O
Egypt    O
since    O
Muhammad    B-Pasha110403768

his    O
wars    O

into    O

the    O
many    O

projects    O

carried    O
,    O
including    O
the    O
costly    O
Suez    O
Canal    O
,    O
put    O
the    O
country    O
heavily    O
in    O
debt    O
.    O

The    O

railway    O
