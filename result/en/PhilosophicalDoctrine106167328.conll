Actual    B-PhilosophicalDoctrine106167328
Idealism    I-PhilosophicalDoctrine106167328

a    O
form    O
of    O

by    O

that    O
grew    O
into    O
a    O
"    O

"    O
idealism    O
contrasting    O
Kant    O
and    O

.    O

Inspired    O
by    O
the    O
occasionalists    B-PhilosophicalDoctrine106167328
of    O
Medieval    O
Islamic    O
Philosophy    O
,    O
Harman    O
maintains    O
that    O

Their    O
views    O
on    O

are    O

Occasionalism    B-PhilosophicalDoctrine106167328
is    O
the    O
view    O
espoused    O
by    O
Nicholas    O
Malebranche    O
that    O
asserts    O
that    O
all    O
supposedly    O
causal    O
relations    O
between    O
physical    O
events    O
,    O
or    O
between    O
physical    O
and    O
mental    O
events    O
,    O
are    O
not    O
really    O
causal    O
at    O
all    O
.    O

He    O
was    O
also    O
a    O
defender    O
of    O
Cartesianism    O
against    O
occasionalism    B-PhilosophicalDoctrine106167328
.    O

He    O
also    O
argues    O
in    O
brief    O
against    O
the    O
idea    O
that    O
causes    O
are    O
mere    O

some    I-PhilosophicalDoctrine106167328
god(s)    I-PhilosophicalDoctrine106167328
,    O

view    O
associated    O
with    O
the    O
philosopher    O
Nicolas    O
Malebranche    O
.    O

It    O
was    O
not    O
until    O
he    O
became    O
a    O
religious    O
sufi    O
that    O
he    O
found    O
a    O
solution    O
to    O
his    O
philosophical    O
problems    O
,    O
which    O
are    O
based    O
on    O
Islamic    O
religion    O
;    O
this    O
encounter    O
with    O
skepticism    O
led    O
Ghazali    O
to    O
embrace    O
a    O
form    O
of    O
theological    O
occasionalism    B-PhilosophicalDoctrine106167328
,    O
or    O
the    O
belief    O
that    O
all    O
causal    O
events    O
and    O
interactions    O
are    O
not    O
the    O
product    O
of    O
material    O
conjunctions    O
but    O
rather    O
the    O
immediate    O

reflects    O
the    O
influence    O
of    O

,    O
Socialist    B-PhilosophicalDoctrine106167328

became    O
the    O
main    O

of    O

control    O
in    O
the    O
building    O

the    O

His    O
initial    O
works    O
had    O
a    O
mystical    O
element    O
,    O
but    O
he    O
downplayed    O

During    O
the    O
1930s    O
,    O
he    O
departed    O
from    O
his    O
familiar    O
themes    O
to    O
paint    O
works    O

However    O
,    O
since    O
he    O
did    O
not    O
follow    O
the    O
official    O
socrealistic    B-PhilosophicalDoctrine106167328
style    O
of    O
literature    O
and    O
was    O
unwilling    O

He    O
also    O
corresponded    O
with    O
Darwin    O
about    O
a    O
variety    O
of    O
topics    O
,    O
including    O

warning    O

the    O
possible    O
effect    O
of    O

selection    O
on    O
hybridisation    O
and    O
the    O
divergence    O
of    O

.    O

Darwin    O
had    O
come    O
to    O
believe    O
that    O
sexual    B-PhilosophicalDoctrine106167328
selection    I-PhilosophicalDoctrine106167328
,    O
an    O
agency    O
to    O
which    O
Wallace    O
did    O
not    O
attribute    O
the    O
same    O
importance    O
as    O
Darwin    O
did    O
,    O
explained    O
many    O

.    O

These    O
views    O
greatly    O
disturbed    O

,    O
who    O
argued    O
that    O
spiritual    O

were    O
not    O
necessary    O
and    O
that    O
sexual    B-PhilosophicalDoctrine106167328

could    O
easily    O
explain    O

,    O
and    O
its    O
characteristics    O
are    O
sometimes    O
used    O
to    O
differentiate    O
between    O
similar    O
species    O
.    O

The    O
evolutionary    O
biologist    O
Richard    O
Dawkins    O
speculated    O
in    O
1989    O
that    O

loss    O
of    O
the    O
bone    O
in    O
humans    O
,    O
when    O
it    O
is    O
present    O
in    O
our    O
nearest    O
related    O
species    O

chimpanzee    O
,    O
is    O
a    O
result    O
of    O
sexual    B-PhilosophicalDoctrine106167328
selection    I-PhilosophicalDoctrine106167328
by    O
females    O
looking    O
for    O

health    O
in    O

only    O
idea    O
of    O
interest    O
which    O

found    O
in    O

that    O

the    O
