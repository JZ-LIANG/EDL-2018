A    O

(    O

,    O
where    O
he    O
witnessed    O
the    O
Armenian    B-Pogrom100421210
Genocide    I-Pogrom100421210
.    O

Many    O
historians    O
and    O
sociologists    O
have    O
suggested    O
that    O
his    O
brand    O
of    O
nationalism    O
contributed    O
to    O
the    O
Armenian    B-Pogrom100421210
Genocide    I-Pogrom100421210
.    O

Eventually    O
the    O
monastery    O
of    O

ceased    O

Scouting    O
in    O
Armenia    O
was    O
founded    O
in    O
1912    O
,    O
then    O
later    O
developed    O
abroad    O
among    O
the    O

who    O
had    O
survived    O

of    I-Pogrom100421210
1915-1916    I-Pogrom100421210

communist    O
occupation    O
of    O
their    O

at    O
which    O
point    O
Scouting    O
ceased    O
to    O

in    O

It    O
is    O
noteworthy    O
that    O
Kütahya    O
and    O
the    O
district    O
itself    O
were    O
spared    O
the    O
ravages    O
of    O
the    O
Armenian    B-Pogrom100421210
Genocide    I-Pogrom100421210
of    O
1915    O
,    O
when    O
the    O
Turkish    O
governor    O
went    O
to    O
extreme    O
lengths    O
to    O
protect    O
the    O
Armenian    O
population    O
from    O
being    O
uprooted    O

the    O

The    O

but    O
it    O
seemed    O
to    O
spill    O
over    O
into    O
the    O
protracted    O
conflicts    O
of    O
the    O

throughout    O
the    O
17th    O

18th    O

19th    O
centuries    O
,    O
such    O
as    O
the    O
Massacres    O
of    O
Badr    O
Khan    O
which    O
resulted    O
in    O
the    O
massacre    O
of    O
over    O
10,000    O
Assyrians    O
in    O
the    O
1840s    O
,    O
culminating    O
in    O
the    O
large    O
scale    O
Hamidian    B-Pogrom100421210

militias    O

which    O
greatly    O
reduced    O
their    O
numbers    O

particularly    O
in    O
southeastern    O
Turkey    O
where    O
over    O
25,000    O

that    O
the    O

the    O
