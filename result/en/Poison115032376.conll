Common    O
causes    O
of    O
ATN    O
include    O
low    O
blood    O

use    O
of    O
nephrotoxic    B-Poison115032376

.    O

Toxic    O
ATN    O
occurs    O
when    O
the    O
tubular    O
cells    O
are    O
exposed    O
to    O
a    O
toxic    O
substance    O
(    O
nephrotoxic    B-Poison115032376

)    O
.    O

This    O
is    O
the    O
effect    O
that    O
accounts    O
for    O
the    O
nephrotoxicity    B-Poison115032376
observed    O
when    O
high    O
serum    O
levels    O
of    O

achieved    O
