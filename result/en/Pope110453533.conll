Despite    O

appeal    O
,    O

was    O

that    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533

to    O

he    O
died    O
in    O
Coimbra    O
on    O
25    O
March    O
1223    O
before    O
making    O
any    O

In    O
July    O

upon    O

to    O

his    O
father    O

vow    O
to    O

Honorius    I-Pope110453533
III    I-Pope110453533
,    O
the    O
idea    O
was    O
ratified    O
and    O
the    O
adoration    O
continued    O
there    O
practically    O
uninterrupted    O
until    O
the    O
chaos    O
of    O
the    O
French    O
Revolution    O
halted    O
it    O
from    O
1792    O
.    O

In    O
1225    O
,    O
it    O
took    O
the    O
intervention    O
of    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Honorius    I-Pope110453533

to    O
settle    O

between    O
the    O
monks    O
of    O
Dryburgh    O
Abbey    O
and    O
the    O
fishermen    O
of    O
Anstruther    O
,    O
suggesting    O
that    O
,    O
even    O
then    O
,    O
the    O
fishing    O
was    O
sufficiently    O
good    O
to    O
warrant    O
arguing    O
over    O
.    O

In    O
the    O
13th    O
century    O
,    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Honorius    I-Pope110453533
III    I-Pope110453533
commissioned    O
the    O
construction    O
of    O
another    O
church    O
in    O
front    O
of    O
the    O
older    O
one    O
.    O

However    O
this    O
authority    O
was    O
disputed    O
by    O
Holy    O
Trinity    O
,    O
and    O
after    O
a    O
lawsuit    O
before    O

duke    O
,    O
who    O
sought    O

an    O

expressing    O
his    O
joy    O

promising    O
the    O
Ruthenians    O
his    O
support    O
.    O

Pope    B-Pope110453533
Clement    I-Pope110453533

a    O

in    O
which    O
the    O
Ruthenian    O

he    O
commanded    O
a    O
significant    O
following    O
in    O

persuaded    O
by    O

to    O
do    O
so    O
,    O
perhaps    O

During    O
the    O
fierce    O

supported    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533

allegedly    O
took    O

his    O
part    O
,    O
the    O
English    O
Protestant    O
John    O
Foxe    O
eagerly    O
repeated    O
the    O
charges    O
which    O
Benno    O
,    O

sided    O
with    O

,    O
made    O
against    O
Henry    O
IV    O
during    O
the    O
Investiture    O
Controversy    O
,    O
such    O
as    O
necromancy    O
,    O
torture    O
of    O
a    O
former    O
friend    O
upon    O
a    O

even    O
burning    O
it    O

He    O
then    O
returned    O
home    O

wrote    O
a    O

responded    O
in    O

to    O
the    O

the    O

Peter    B-Pope110453533

a    O

to    O

However    O
,    O

Alexandria    O
,    O
and    O
Peter    O
the    O
Fuller    O
Patriarch    O
of    O
Antioch    O
had    O
all    O
signed    O
it    O
.    O

He    O
was    O
a    O
convinced    O
adherent    O
of    O
the    O
Council    O
of    O
Chalcedon    O
and    O
refused    O
to    O
sign    O
Emperor    O
Zeno    O
's    O
Henoticon    O
(    O
which    O
glossed    O
over    O
the    O
Council    O
of    O

)    O
.    O
Because    O
of    O
this    O
,    O
the    O
Emperor    O
expelled    O
him    O
and    O
recognized    O
the    O
Miaphysite    O
claimant    O
Peter    B-Pope110453533
Mongus    I-Pope110453533
as    O
the    O
legitimate    O

the    O
condition    O
that    O
he    O
would    O
sign    O

Peter    B-Pope110453533

.    O

Iconoclasm    O
played    O
its    O
part    O
in    O
the    O
further    O
alienation    O
of    O
East    O
from    O
West    O
,    O
which    O
worsened    O
during    O
the    O
so    O
-    O
called    O
Photian    O
Schism    O
,    O
when    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Nicholas    I-Pope110453533
I    I-Pope110453533
challenged    O
Photios    O
'    O
elevation    O
to    O
the    O
patriarchate    O
.    O

Rome    O
and    O
the    O
Byzantine    O
East    O
would    O
delve    O
into    O
further    O
conflict    O
during    O
the    O
Photian    O
schism    O
of    O
the    O
860s    O
,    O
when    O
Photius    O
criticised    O
the    O
Latin    O
west    O
of    O
adding    O
of    O
the    O
"    O
filioque    O
"    O
clause    O
after    O
being    O
excommunicated    O
by    O
Nicholas    B-Pope110453533
I    I-Pope110453533
Though    O
the    O
schism    O
was    O
reconciled    O
,    O
unresolved    O
issues    O
would    O
lead    O
to    O
further    O
division    O
.    O

Pope    B-Pope110453533
Nicholas    I-Pope110453533
I    I-Pope110453533
sent    O
apostolic    O
legates    O
to    O
investigate    O
the    O
matter    O
,    O
but    O
Lothair    O
's    O
bishops    O
affirmed    O
that    O
they    O
had    O
advised    O
him    O
to    O
spurn    O
his    O
lawful    O
wife    O

take    O
another    O

Finally    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Nicholas    I-Pope110453533
I    I-Pope110453533
took    O
up    O
the    O
case    O
,    O
and    O
summoned    O
Hincmar    O
to    O
the    O
council    O
of    O
Metz    O
(    O
863    O

.    O

Pope    B-Pope110453533
Nicholas    I-Pope110453533

Photios    O
I    O
of    O
Constantinople    O
,    O
who    O
in    O
turn    O
had    O
attacked    O
the    O
pope    O
as    O
a    O
heretic    O
,    O
because    O
he    O
kept    O
the    O
filioque    O
in    O
the    O
creed    O
,    O
which    O
referred    O
to    O

successor    O

of    O
Constantinople    O
.    O

Ignatius    O
refused    O
to    O
abdicate    O
,    O
setting    O
up    O
a    O
power    O
struggle    O
between    O
the    O
Emperor    O
and    O

that    O

:    O

to    O
mean    O
that    O
the    O
Canon    O
of    O
the    O
Mass    O
is    O
the    O
firm    O
rule    O
according    O
to    O
which    O
the    O

The    O
previous    O
legitimate    O
Pope    O
John    O
is    O
generally    O
considered    O
to    O
be    O
John    B-Pope110453533

(    O
985–996    O

XVI    I-Pope110453533
(    O
997–998    O

was    O
an    O
antipope    O
according    O
to    O
official    O
reckoning    O
,    O
and    O
thus    O
his    O
regnal    O
number    O
XVI    O
should    O
have    O
been    O
reused    O
.    O

Pope    O
John    O
XVIII    O
was    O
only    O
the    O
17th    O
pope    O
called    O
John    O
,    O
because    O
John    B-Pope110453533
XVI    I-Pope110453533
(    O
997–998    O
)    O
was    O
an    O

official    O
reckoning    O
.    O

These    O
discrepancies    O
in    O
regnal    O
numbers    O
are    O
due    O
in    O
part    O
to    O
a    O
now    O
discounted    O
belief    O
in    O
another    O

and    O
by    O
a    O
penitent    O

a    O
letter    O
of    O

Gregory    O
levied    O
a    O
second    O
excommunication    O
against    O
Henry    O
,    O
who    O
ultimately    O
won    O
the    O
civil    O
war    O
,    O
invaded    O
Rome    O
,    O
and    O
forced    O

During    O
the    O
Investiture    O
Controversy    O
,    O
both    O
the    O
legitimate    O

developed    O
another    O

not    O
entirely    O
new    O
,    O
practice    O
.    O

Ladislaus    O
also    O
recognized    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Victor    I-Pope110453533
III    I-Pope110453533
as    O
the    O
legitimate    O

rather    O
than    O
Clement    B-Pope110453533

,    O
who    O
had    O
been    O
elected    O
pope    O
at    O
Henry    O

initiative    O
.    O

Antipope    B-Pope110453533
Clement    I-Pope110453533
III    I-Pope110453533
was    O
an    O
alternative    O
pope    O
for    O
most    O
of    O
this    O
period    O
,    O
and    O
Pope    O
Urban    O
spent    O
much    O
of    O
his    O
early    O
pontificate    O
in    O
exile    O
from    O
Rome    O
.    O

Gilbert    O
(    O
1059    O
)    O
and    O
Giselbert    O
(    O
1080    O
)    O
were    O
also    O
promoters    O
of    O
reform    O
,    O
while    O
Richard    O
(    O
1086    O
)    O
adhered    O
to    O
the    O
antipope    B-Pope110453533
Clement    I-Pope110453533
III    I-Pope110453533
,    O
who    O
united    O
with    O
Toscanella    O
Centumcellae    O
and    O
the    O
see    O
of    O
Blera    O
.    O

This    O
was    O
because    O
of    O
historians    O
relying    O
on    O
texts    O
actually    O
describing    O
another    O
castle    O
,    O
the    O
Château    O
de    O
Haut    O

in    O
1048    O
,    O
a    O
clear    O
distinction    O
developed    O
between    O
two    O
classes    O
of    O
bulls    O
of    O
greater    O
and    O
less    O
solemnity    O
.    O

He    O
was    O
canonized    O
on    O
3    O
December    O
1049    O
by    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Leo    I-Pope110453533

his    O
memorial    O
day    O
is    O

.    O

Nine    O
more    O
bishops    O
ruled    O
here    O
until    O
1050    O
,    O
when    O
Leofric    O
obtained    O
papal    O
permission    O
from    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Leo    I-Pope110453533
IX    I-Pope110453533
to    O
transfer    O
the    O
seat    O
to    O
Exeter    O
,    O

more    O
culturally    O

in    O
confirming    O
the    O

in    O
France    O

the    O
preceding    O
grants    O
of    O
Benedict    O
and    O
Christopher    O
.    O

The    O

him    O

the    O

respect    O

the    O
pope    O
to    O
Benevento    O
,    O
where    O
he    O
was    O
held    O
until    O
shortly    O
before    O
his    O
death    O
in    O
1054    O
.    O

His    O
reputation    O
for    O
holiness    O
was    O
evident    O
in    O
his    O
life    O
and    O
miracles    O
at    O
his    O
tomb    O
were    O
recorded    O
after    O

21    O
October    O
1050    O
in    O
Rome    O
.    O

His    O
canonization    O
was    O
celebrated    O
under    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533

venerated    O
the    O
late    O
bishop    O

This    O

started    O
to    O

,    O
was    O
a    O
young    O
monk    O
and    O
great    O
provost    O
here    O
,    O
but    O
his    O
family    O
played    O
a    O
great    O
role    O
in    O
the    O
elevated    O
status    O
of    O
this    O

At    O
first    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Leo    I-Pope110453533
IX    I-Pope110453533
was    O
cautious    O
of    O
the    O
Normans    O
but    O
he    O
came    O
to    O
appreciate    O
their    O
usefulness    O
to    O
the    O
papacy    O
in    O
ousting    O
the    O
Byzantine    O
authority    O
in    O
the    O
south    O
.    O

Though    O
normally    O
dated    O
to    O
1054    O
,    O
when    O
Pope    O
Leo    B-Pope110453533
IX    I-Pope110453533
and    O
Patriarch    O
of    O
Constantinople    O
Michael    O

each    O
other    O
,    O
the    O
East    O
-    O
West    O
Schism    O
was    O
actually    O
the    O
result    O
of    O
an    O
extended    O
period    O
of    O
estrangement    O
between    O
the    O
two    O
Churches    O
.    O

Even    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Leo    I-Pope110453533
IX    I-Pope110453533
knew    O
about    O
him    O
and    O
travelled    O
to    O
his    O
convent    O
to    O
visit    O
and    O
speak    O
with    O
the    O
monk    O
.    O

In    O
1053    O
it    O
is    O
likely    O
that    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Leo    I-Pope110453533
IX    I-Pope110453533
used    O
Guardialfiera    O
as    O
a    O
base    O
in    O
order    O
to    O
launch    O
an    O
attack    O
against    O
the    O
Normans    O
who    O
had    O
occupied    O
the    O
nearby    O
town    O
of    O
Larino    O
in    O
1050    O
.    O

It    O
is    O
unclear    O
if    O
the    O
present    O
structure    O
was    O
standing    O
at    O
the    O
time    O
of    O

visit    O
in    O
1053    O
,    O
but    O
the    O
diocese    O
records    O
clearly    O
show    O
that    O
the    O
designation    O
of    O
Santa    O
Maria    O
dell'Assunta    O
was    O
elevated    O

to    O

in    O

that    O
there    O
were    O
already    O

living    O
in    O

The    O
Latin    O
alphabet    O
was    O
in    O
use    O
by    O
431    O
,    O
when    O
the    O
fifth    O
century    O
Gaulish    O
chronicler    O
Prosper    O
of    O
Aquitaine    O
records    O
that    O
Palladius    O
was    O
sent    O
by    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Celestine    I-Pope110453533
I    I-Pope110453533
as    O
the    O
first    O

to    O
the    O
Irish    O
believers    O
in    O
Christ    O
.    O

In    O
431    O
he    O
appeared    O
in    O
Rome    O
to    O
interview    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Celestine    I-Pope110453533
I    I-Pope110453533
regarding    O
the    O
teachings    O
of    O
Augustine    O
;    O
there    O
is    O
no    O
further    O
trace    O
of    O
him    O
until    O
440    O
,    O
the    O
first    O
year    O
of    O
the    O
pontificate    O
of    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Leo    I-Pope110453533
I    I-Pope110453533
,    O
who    O
had    O
been    O
in    O
Gaul    O
,    O
where    O
he    O
may    O
have    O
met    O
Prosper    O
.    O

With    O
the    O
help    O
of    O
Augustine    O
and    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Celestine    I-Pope110453533
,    O
Prosper    O
was    O
able    O
to    O
put    O
down    O
revolutions    O
of    O
the    O
Pelagian    O
Christians    O
.    O

This    O
judgment    O
is    O
the    O
more    O
interesting    O
as    O
being    O
in    O
distinct    O
conflict    O
with    O
the    O
opinion    O
of    O
the    O
bishop    O
of    O
Rome    O
—    O
Leo    B-Pope110453533
—    O
who    O
,    O
departing    O
from    O
the    O
policy    O
of    O
his    O
predecessor    O
Celestine    B-Pope110453533
,    O
had    O
written    O
very    O
strongly    O
to    O
Flavian    O
in    O
support    O
of    O
the    O
doctrine    O
of    O
the    O
two    O
natures    O
and    O
one    O
person    O
.    O

The    O
latter    O
addressed    O
a    O
letter    O
to    O
the    O
bishop    O
of    O
Rome    O
,    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Celestine    I-Pope110453533
I    I-Pope110453533
,    O
protesting    O
against    O
his    O
claim    O
to    O
appellate    O
jurisdiction    O
,    O
and    O
urgently    O
requesting    O
the    O
immediate    O
recall    O
of    O
his    O
legate    O
,    O
and    O
advising    O
him    O
to    O
send    O
no    O
more    O
judges    O
to    O
Africa    O
.    O

Even    O
more    O
decisively    O
he    O
involves    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Celestine    I-Pope110453533
I    I-Pope110453533
in    O
this    O
event    O
and    O
since    O
Pope    O
Celestine    O
died    O
in    O
432    O
it    O
must    O
have    O
occurred    O
before    O
that    O
time    O
–    O
which    O
Professor    O
Barrett    O
argues    O
would    O
not    O
allow    O
time    O
for    O
a    O
second    O
visit    O
.    O
-    O
especially    O
since    O
,    O
according    O
to    O
Constantius    O
,    O
that    O
second    O
visit    O
happened    O
after    O
Germanus    O
's    O
visit    O
to    O
Arles    O
to    O
secure    O
tax    O
relief    O
,    O
something    O
that    O
probably    O
occurred    O
in    O
the    O
mid-430s    O
.    O

his    O
1896    O
bull    O
"    O
Apostolicae    O

"    O
that    O

are    O
"    O
absolutely    O
null    O

Pope    O
(    O

,    O
born    O
Odo    O
Colona    O

After    O
Hallam    O
's    O
death    O
the    O
cardinals    O
were    O
able    O
to    O
secure    O
the    O
immediate    O
election    O
of    O
a    O
new    O
pope    O
,    O
Martin    B-Pope110453533
V    I-Pope110453533
,    O
who    O
was    O
elected    O
on    O
11    O
November    O
:    O
it    O
has    O
been    O
said    O
that    O
the    O
abandonment    O
of    O
the    O
reformers    O
by    O
the    O
English    O
was    O
due    O
entirely    O
to    O
Hallam    O
's    O
death    O
;    O
but    O
it    O
is    O
more    O
likely    O
that    O
Henry    O
V    O
,    O
foreseeing    O
the    O
possible    O
need    O
for    O
a    O
change    O
of    O
front    O
,    O
had    O
given    O
Hallam    O
discretionary    O
powers    O
which    O
the    O
bishop    O
's    O
successors    O
used    O
.    O

In    O
1427    O
he    O
arrived    O
in    O
Rome    O

which    O
was    O
completed    O
by    O
Pisanello    O
after    O
his    O
death    O
.    O

In    O
the    O
fifteenth    O
century    O
,    O
the    O
hospital    O
enjoyed    O
remarkable    O
economic    O
prosperity    O

a    O
major    O
transformation    O

There    O
was    O
an    O
opinion    O
in    O
the    O
Church    O
that    O
viewed    O
that    O
perhaps    O
the    O
Council    O
understood    O
the    O
Church    O
of    O
Alexandria    O
correctly    O
,    O
but    O
wanted    O
to    O
curtail    O
the    O
existing    O
power    O
of    O
the    O
Alexandrine    O
Hierarch    O
,    O
especially    O
after    O

unfortunate    O
turnouts    O
of    O
the    O
Second    O

of    O

in    O
449    O
AD    O

misled    O

the    O
Council    O
in    O
confessing    O
the    O

in    O
writing    O
and    O
then    O
renouncing    O
it    O
after    O
the    O
Council    O
,    O
which    O
in    O
turn    O
,    O
had    O
upset    O
Rome    O
,    O
especially    O
that    O
the    O

but    O
the    O

refuted    O
him    O
,    O
emphasizing    O
that    O
the    O
Byzantines    O

lost    O
their    O

granted    O

its    O

approval    O
with    O

the    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Innocent    I-Pope110453533

who    O
backed    O
up    O
their    O
plans    O
to    O
Christianize    O
Livonia    O
.    O

The    O
actual    O
construction    O
of    O
the    O
tower    O
probably    O
dates    O
to    O
the    O
time    O
of    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Innocent    I-Pope110453533
III    I-Pope110453533
(    O
1198–1216    O
)    O
under    O
the    O
Aretino    O
family    O
.    O

When    O
in    O
his    O
forties    O
,    O
he    O
works    O
for    O
a    O
breakaway    O
Christian    O
sect    O
known    O
as    O
the    O
Cathars    O
during    O
their    O
hopeless    O
last    O
stand    O
against    O
the    O
forces    O
of    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Innocent    I-Pope110453533
III    I-Pope110453533
,    O
in    O
which    O
he    O
is    O
mortally    O
wounded    O
.    O

He    O
accompanied    O
the    O
saint    O
to    O
Rome    O
when    O
the    O
first    O
Rule    O
was    O
approved    O
orally    O
by    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Innocent    I-Pope110453533
III    I-Pope110453533
,    O
and    O
appears    O
to    O
have    O
then    O
received    O
the    O
monastic    O
tonsure    O
.    O

However    O
,    O
even    O
at    O
that    O
stage    O
he    O
also    O
agreed    O
to    O
an    O
open    O
invasion    O
,    O
despite    O
discouragement    O
from    O
his    O
father    O
and    O
from    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Innocent    I-Pope110453533
III    I-Pope110453533
.    O

The    O
university    O
was    O
placed    O
squarely    O
under    O
direct    O
papal    O
patronage    O
,    O
part    O
of    O
the    O
program    O
to    O
centralise    O
the    O
Church    O
structure    O
,    O
which    O
had    O
intensified    O
under    O
Innocent    B-Pope110453533
III    I-Pope110453533
.    O

A    O
site    O
here    O
was    O
projected    O
in    O
the    O
1180s    O
by    O
Archbishop    O
Baldwin    O
as    O
the    O
site    O
of    O
a    O
new    O
college    O

was    O

contain    O
the    O
archiepiscopal    O
"    O
cathedra    O
"    O
and    O

king    O
and    O
the    O
bishops    O
of    O
the    O
province    O
of    O
Canterbury    O
but    O
the    O
monks    O
of    O

procured    O
a    O
veto    O
for    O
the    O

heard    O

received    O
the    O

The    O
symbolic    O
significance    O
of    O
the    O

both    O
supreme    O
spiritual    O

increasing    O
numbers    O
of    O

for    O
whom    O
Landelin    O
had    O
a    O

In    O

widely    O

a    O

for    O

of    O

The    O
calendar    O
depicts    O
a    O
female    O
warrior    O
with    O
a    O
spear    O
and    O

Internal    O
evidence    O
from    O
the    O
documents    O
has    O
been    O
taken    O
to    O
suggest    O
that    O
the    O
author    O
was    O
active    O
in    O
Rome    O
during    O
the    O
period    O
of    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
Damasus    I-Pope110453533

,    O
a    O
member    O

that    O
it    O
was    O
ordered    O
in    O
the    O
fourth    O

by    O

The    O

of    O
this    O

places    O
the    O
two    O

quite    O
differently    O
from    O
the    O
poem    O
of    O

Damasus    I-Pope110453533

as    O
Nereus    O

beginning    O
of    O
the    O
2nd    O

,    O
we    O
may    O
conclude    O
that    O
they    O
are    O
among    O
the    O
most    O
ancient    O
martyrs    O
of    O
the    O
Roman    O
Church    O
,    O
and    O
stand    O

Domitilla    O

The    O
lowest    O
point    O
was    O
touched    O
in    O
897    O
,    O
when    O
a    O

The    O

disaster    O
at    O

produced    O
an    O
exodus    O
towards    O

of    O

clerics    O

As    O
can    O
be    O
read    O
in    O
his    O
21    O

testament    O
written    O
at    O

John    O
identified    O
himself    O
as    O
the    O
king    O
of    O
Portugal    O
and    O
possible    O
effective    O
owner    O
of    O
the    O
kingdom    O
,    O
saying    O
that    O
if    O
he    O
predeceased    O
his    O
wife    O
,    O
the    O
Pope    B-Pope110453533
should    O
decide    O
whether    O

or    O
his    O
son    O
(    O
her    O
stepson    O
)    O
Henry    O
should    O
be    O
the    O

was    O
appointed    O

stating    O
that    O
the    O

a    O
forgery    O

is    O

it    O

that    O

This    O
change    O
of    O

became    O
more    O
clear    O
when    O

it    O

assured    O
