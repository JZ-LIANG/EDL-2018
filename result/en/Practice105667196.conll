but    O
by    O
the    O
1930s    O
it    O
had    O
become    O

Some    O
Chinese    O

that    O

This    O
was    O
probably    O
due    O
to    O

The    O
individuals    O

Its    O
cause    O
is    O
unknown    O

there    O
is    O

remark    O
about    O

almost    O
caused    O
an    O

to    O
be    O
a    O
direct    O
cause    O
of    O
bronchiectasis    O
,    O
it    O
is    O
certainly    O
an    O
irritant    O
that    O
all    O
patients    O
should    O
avoid    O
in    O

the    O

,    O
and    O
in    O
1956    O
provided    O
convincing    O
statistical    O
evidence    O
that    O

increases    O
the    O

The    O
RII    O
is    O
particularly    O
valuable    O
when    O
comparing    O
risk    O
factors    O

that    O
are    O

The    O

The    O
strongest    O
over    O
-    O
all    O

is    O
based    O
on    O
what    O

counts    O
as    O
the    O
second    O
of    O
the    O

The    O
Sabbath    O
is    O
still    O
widely    O
observed    O
in    O
Stornoway    O
;    O
it    O
is    O
home    O
to    O
a    O
number    O
of    O
members    O
of    O
the    O
Lord    O
's    O
Day    O
Observance    O
Society    O
,    O
which    O
lobbies    O
for    O
no    O
work    O
on    O
the    O
Christian    O
Sabbath    O
(    O
Sundays    O
)    O
,    O
based    O
on    O
its    O
interpretation    O
of    O
the    O
fourth    O
(    O
by    O
the    O
Hebrew    O

Thus    O
he    O
contends    O
that    O
not    O
even    O
God    O
can    O
change    O
the    O
Ten    B-Practice105667196
Commandments    I-Practice105667196
(    O
adding    O
,    O
however    O
,    O
that    O
God    O
"    O
can    O
"    O
change    O
what    O
individuals    O
deserve    O
in    O
particular    O
cases    O
,    O
in    O
what    O
might    O
look    O
like    O
special    O
dispensations    O
to    O
murder    O
or    O
steal    O
)    O
.    O

This    O
view    O
was    O
partially    O
defended    O
by    O
Duns    O
Scotus    O
,    O
who    O
argued    O
that    O
not    O
all    O

Commandments    I-Practice105667196
belong    O
to    O
the    O

sense    O
.    O

were    O

Christianity    O
and    O
Judaism    O
assert    O
that    O
God    O
intervened    O
in    O
key    O
specific    O
moments    O
in    O
history    O
,    O
especially    O
at    O
the    O

of    O

,    O
positing    O
an    O
argument    O
from    O
empirical    O
evidence    O
stemming    O
from    O
sheer    O
number    O
of    O
witnesses    O
,    O
thus    O
demonstrating    O
his    O
existence    O

are    O

Monastic    O
life    O
is    O
particularly    O
important    O
in    O
the    O

of    O
the    O
Eastern    O
Christian    O
Churches    O

This    O
was    O
understood    O
as    O
a    O
symbol    O
of    O
their    O

Another    O

,    O
which    O
the    O
Roman    O

tradition    O
interprets    O
as    O
forsaking    O
sex    O
and    O
procreation    O
for    O
a    O
superior    O
chastity    O
and    O
higher    O
supernatural    O
ends    O
.    O

Impediments    O
vary    O
between    O
legal    O
jurisdictions    O
,    O
but    O
would    O
normally    O
include    O
a    O
pre    O
-    O
existing    O
marriage    O
that    O
has    O
been    O
neither    O
dissolved    O

annulled    O

of    O

In    O
the    O
rest    O
of    O
Spain    O
there    O
was    O
"    O
an    O
older    O
tradition    O
of    O
individual    O
or    O
family    O
asceticism    O
,    O
represented    O
by    O
voluntary    O

and    O
the    O
setting    O
up    O
of    O
private    O

In    O
1807    O
,    O
celibacy    B-Practice105667196
was    O
advocated    O
as    O
the    O
preferred    O
custom    O
of    O
the    O
community    O
in    O
an    O

This    O
is    O
perhaps    O
why    O
they    O
believed    O
that    O
people    O
should    O
try    O
to    O
make    O
themselves    O
"    O
pure    O
"    O

"    O
perfect    O

"    O

"    O
(    O
Acts    O
4:32    O
-    O
37    O
)    O
and    O
practicing    O
celibacy    B-Practice105667196
.    O

The    O
Harmonites    O
tended    O
to    O
view    O
unmarried    O
celibate    B-Practice105667196
life    O
as    O
morally    O
superior    O
to    O
marriage    O
,    O
based    O
on    O
Rapp    O
's    O
belief    O
that    O
God    O
had    O
originally    O
created    O
Adam    O
as    O
a    O
dual    O
being    O
having    O
male    O
and    O
female    O
sexual    O
organs    O
.    O

The    O
Harmonite    O
commune    O
ultimately    O
failed    O
because    O
the    O
policy    O
of    O
celibacy    B-Practice105667196
prevented    O
new    O
members    O
from    O
within    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
majority    O
of    O
the    O
outside    O
world    O
had    O
no    O
desire    O
to    O
give    O
up    O
so    O
much    O
to    O
live    O
in    O
a    O
commune    O

They    O

no    O

thus    O
