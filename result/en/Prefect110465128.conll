Gregory    B-Prefect110465128
the    I-Prefect110465128
Dialogist    I-Prefect110465128
,    O
Pope    O
of    O

,    O
with    O
St.    O
Augustine    O
of    O
Canterbury    O
.    O

This    O
would    O
have    O
been    O
consistent    O
with    O
the    O
advice    O
given    O
by    O

in    O

that    O
Saxon    O
shrines    O
should    O
be    O
converted    O
to    O
Christian    O
use    O
,    O
rather    O
than    O
being    O
destroyed    O
,    O
and    O
that    O
pagan    O
festivals    O
and    O
rites    O
should    O
be    O
converted    O
into    O
Christian    O
ones    O
.    O

It    O
is    O
strongly    O
inferred    O
that    O
St    O
Paulinus    O
,    O
from    O
the    O
Canterbury    O
mission    O
,    O
was    O
present    O
in    O
East    O

at    O
Rædwald    O
's    O
court    O
in    O
around    O
616    O
,    O
and    O
it    O
seems    O
likely    O
that    O
the    O
dedication    O
of    O

belongs    O
to    O
the    O
early    O
phases    O
of    O
