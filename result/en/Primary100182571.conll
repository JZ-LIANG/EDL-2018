After    O

a    O

"    O
tantamount    B-Primary100182571
to    I-Primary100182571
election    I-Primary100182571
"    O
because    O
the    O
Republican    O
Party    O
was    O
so    O
weak    O
in    O
the    O
South    O

Throughout    O
most    O

a    O
national    O

,    O
some    O
states    O
were    O

,    O
Roberts    O
easily    O
won    O

which    O
was    O
tantamount    B-Primary100182571

from    O

Crump    O
machine    O
,    O
Kefauver    O
won    O
the    O
Democratic    O
nomination    O
,    O
which    O
in    O
those    O
days    O
was    O
tantamount    B-Primary100182571

As    O
there    O
were    O
no    O
candidates    O
running    O
for    O
sheriff    O
in    O
any    O
other    O
parties    O
,    O
the    O
winner    O
of    O
the    O

would    O
automatically    B-Primary100182571
