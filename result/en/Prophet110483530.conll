Later    O

ancient    O

from    O

a    O

fabricated    O

from    O
two    O

Burnus    O

Regarding    O
the    O
flood    O
that    O

encountered    O
,    O
it    O

forty    O

water    O
continued    O

The    O

another    O

son    O
of    O

a    O

selected    O
by    O
Augustus    O
to    O
receive    O
a    O
Roman    O
colony    O
,    O
probably    O
as    O
a    O
measure    O
of    O
precaution    O
,    O
on    O
account    O
of    O
the    O
strength    O
of    O
its    O
situation    O
,    O
as    O
we    O
are    O
told    O
that    O
he    O
expelled    O
the    O
former    O
inhabitants    O
to    O
make    O
room    O
for    O
his    O

one    O
of    O
the    O
oldest    O
cities    O

,    O
but    O
does    O
not    O
appear    O
in    O
history    O
until    O
the    O
Roman    O
colonization    O
of    O
247    O
BCE    O
,    O
and    O
was    O
never    O
of    O
great    O
importance    O
,    O
except    O
as    O
a    O
resort    O
of    O

many    O
of    O
whom    O

the    O
Antonine    O
emperors    O

had    O
villas    O
there    O
.    O

It    O
appears    O
to    O
have    O
early    O
become    O
a    O
favorite    O
resort    O
with    O
the    O
wealthy    O
Romans    O
as    O
a    O
place    O
of    O
retirement    O

pleasure    O
;    O
thus    O
we    O

that    O

,    O
where    O
he    O
landed    O
on    O
his    O
return    O
from    O
Africa    O
,    O
and    O
at    O
which    O
all    O
the    O
nobles    O
of    O
Rome    O
hastened    O
to    O
greet    O
him    O
.    O

Picenum    O

also    O
the    O

He    O
died    O
in    O

not    O
ultimately    O
the    O
eulogization    O
of    O

,    O
but    O
is    O
rather    O
the    O

analysis    O
of    O

inner    O

The    O
midrash    O

the    O

itself    O
states    O
:    O
"    O

We    O
sent    O
down    O
the    O

,    O
wherein    O
is    O

the    O

(    O

followed    O
him    O
)    O
,    O
who    O

,    O
they    O
were    O
also    O
accused    O
of    O
burning    O

it    O

According    O
to    O
the    O
Samaritan    O
's    O
tradition    O
,    O
the    O
office    O
has    O
existed    O
continuously    O
since    O
the    O
time    O
of    O
Aaron    B-Prophet110483530
,    O
the    O
brother    O
of    O
Moses    B-Prophet110483530

has    O
been    O
held    O
by    O
132    O
priests    O
in    O
the    O
last    O
thirty    O
-    O
four    O
centuries    O

In    O
1624    O
,    O
the    O
last    O
Samaritan    O

of    O
the    O
line    O
of    O
Eleazar    O
son    O
of    O
Aaron    B-Prophet110483530
died    O
without    O
male    O
succession    O
,    O
but    O
descendants    O
of    O
Aaron    O
's    O
other    O
son    O
,    O
Ithamar    O
,    O
remained    O

the    O

Thus    O
,    O
Muslims    O
have    O
traditionally    O
had    O
no    O
problem    O
accepting    O
those    O
other    O
Hebrew    O
prophets    O
not    O
mentioned    O
in    O
the    O
Quran    O
or    O
hadith    O
as    O
legitimate    O
prophets    O
of    O
God    O
,    O
especially    O
as    O
the    O
Quran    O
itself    O
states    O
:    O
"    O
Surely    O
We    O
sent    O
down    O
the    O
Torah    O
(    O
to    O
Moses    O
)    O
,    O
wherein    O
is    O
guidance    O
and    O
light    O
;    O
thereby    O
the    O
Prophets    O
(    O
who    O
followed    O
him    O
)    O
,    O
who    O
had    O
surrendered    O
themselves    O
,    O
gave    O
judgment    O
for    O
those    O
who    O
were    O
Jewish    O
,    O
as    O
did    O
the    O
masters    O
and    O
the    O
rabbis    O
,    O
following    O
such    O
portion    O
of    O
God    O
's    O

as    O
they    O
were    O

to    O

"    O
with    O
this    O
passage    O
having    O
often    O
been    O
interpreted    O
by    O
Muslims    O
to    O
include    O
within    O
the    O
phrase    O
"    O
prophets    O

an    O
allusion    O
to    O

the    O

of    O

to    O

David    O
was    O

buried    O
within    O
the    O
City    O
of    O
David    O
together    O
with    O
"    O
his    O

"    O
;    O
by    O
contrast    O
,    O
the    O
4th    O
century    O
Pilgrim    O
of    O
Bordeaux    O
reports    O
that    O
he    O
discovered    O
David    O
to    O
be    O
buried    O
in    O
Bethlehem    O
,    O
in    O
a    O
vault    O
that    O
also    O

the    O
siege    O
was    O
raised    O

facts    O
that    O
the    O

Roman    O
emperor    O

In    O

After    O

's    O
death    O
in    O
68    O
AD    O
,    O
Rome    O

and    O
a    O
year    O
of    O
civil    O
wars    O
until    O
Vespasian    B-Prophet110483530
eventually    O
took    O
control    O

Licinius    O
Mucianus    O
,    O
a    O
supporter    O
of    O
Vespasian    B-Prophet110483530
,    O
was    O
advancing    O
with    O
an    O
army    O
through    O
Moesia    O
towards    O
Rome    O
to    O
overthrow    O
Vitellius    O
.    O

He    O
is    O
mentioned    O
by    O
Tacitus    O
as    O
having    O
been    O
one    O
of    O
two    O
witnesses    O
who    O
were    O
present    O
at    O

conferences    O
between    O

the    O
elder    O
brother    O

legions    O
from    O
the    O
East    O
were    O
marching    O
rapidly    O
on    O
the    O
capital    O
.    O

The    O
incapacity    O
of    O
Vitellius    O
tempted    O
Vespasian    B-Prophet110483530
to    O
take    O
up    O
arms    O
against    O
him    O
.    O

The    O
Roman    O
historian    O
Suetonius    O
mentions    O
that    O
the    O
island    O
was    O
captured    O
by    O
the    O
commander    O
Vespasian    B-Prophet110483530

After    O
his    O
death    O
,    O
his    O
widow    O
with    O
their    O
children    O
went    O
to    O
a    O
Roman    O
Senate    O
meeting    O
in    O

in    O
the    O
reign    O
of    O
Roman    O
emperor    O

vengeance    O
for    O
Frugi    O
’s    O
death    O
.    O

quashed    O
by    O
the    O
Emperor    B-Prophet110483530

This    O

had    O
wider    O

He    O
was    O
allowed    O

he    O

According    O
to    O
modern    O
historians    O
the    O
foundation    O
of    O
the    O

was    O
an    O

by    O
the    O
emperor    O
Octavian    B-Prophet110483530
to    O
create    O
a    O
strong    O
city    O
of    O
his    O

in    O
an    O
area    O
of    O
Betica    O
(    O

that    O
had    O
overwhelmingly    O
supported    O
Pompey    O
during    O
the    O
Civil    O
War    O
.    O

Creation    O
of    O
this    O
mint    O
was    O
part    O
of    O
the    O
propaganda    O
drive    O
by    O
Octavius    B-Prophet110483530
to    O
show    O
the    O
divine    O
character    O
of    O
the    O
emperor    O
.    O

Augustus    B-Prophet110483530
divided    O

An    O

might    O

patron    O
or    O

to    O
celebrate    O
his    O
victory    O
over    O
the    O

tribes    O
which    O
lived    O
in    O
the    O
mountains    O
of    O
the    O

attacked    O
the    O

trade    O
routes    O
.    O

The    O

legion    O
was    O
thus    O
probably    O
bereft    O

(    O
a    O
tiny    O
cavalry    O
force    O
of    O
120    O

was    O
probably    O
added    O
back    O

in    O

,    O
which    O

at    O
the    O
height    O
of    O
his    O
career    O
,    O
Verrius    O
Flaccus    O
,    O
whose    O
prestige    O
allowed    O
him    O
to    O

,    O
before    O

to    O
a    O
larger    O
region    O

it    O
was    O
during    O
the    O
reign    O
of    O
Augustus    B-Prophet110483530
,    O
at    O
the    O

of    O
the    O
1st    O

that    O
the    O

the    O
transition    O

the    O

actually    O
born    O
around    O
4    O

deriving    O
this    O
from    O
the    O

of    O

Julius    B-Prophet110483530
Caesar    I-Prophet110483530
is    O
considered    O
the    O
last    O
dictator    O
of    O
the    O
Roman    O
Republic    O
,    O
a    O
view    O
having    O
its    O
origins    O
in    O
the    O
Roman    O
writers    O

Octavian    O
appeared    O
before    O
the    O
Senate    O

offered    O
to    O
retire    O
from    O
active    O
politics    O
and    O
government    O
;    O
the    O
Senate    O
not    O
only    O
requested    O
he    O
remain    O
,    O
but    O
increased    O
his    O
powers    O
and    O
made    O
them    O
lifelong    O
,    O
awarding    O
him    O
the    O
title    O
of    O
Augustus    B-Prophet110483530
(    O
the    O
elevated    O

divine    O
one    O

approaching    O

In    O

under    O
Octavian    B-Prophet110483530
's    O
command    O

this    O

established    O
the    O
rule    O
that    O

assume    O
both    O

of    O

It    O
was    O
the    O
title    O
most    O
preferred    O
by    O
Caesar    B-Prophet110483530
Augustus    I-Prophet110483530
as    O
its    O
use    O
implies    O
only    O
primacy    O
,    O
as    O
opposed    O
to    O
another    O
of    O
his    O
titles    O
,    O
"    O

"    O
,    O

implies    O
dominance    O

the    O
letters    O
of    O

the    O

bestowed    O
on    O
him    O
a    O
great    O
deal    O
of    O
wealth    O
,    O
which    O
he    O
used    O
to    O
purchase    O
large    O
parcels    O
of    O
land    O
in    O

The    O
theatre    O
was    O
built    O
between    O
5    O
and    O
1    O
BC    O
,    O
as    O
has    O
been    O
proven    O
by    O
the    O
dedication    O
of    O
the    O
edifice    O
to    O
Gaius    O
and    O
Lucius    O
Caesar    O
,    O

of    O

who    O
had    O
designated    O
them    O
as    O
his    O
successors    O
.    O

Originally    O
called    O
Aspurgus    O
,    O
he    O
adopted    O
the    O
Roman    O
names    O
"    O
Tiberius    O
Julius    O
"    O
because    O
he    O
received    O
Roman    O
citizenship    O
and    O
enjoyed    O
the    O
patronage    O
of    O
the    O
first    O
two    O
Roman    O
Emperors    O
,    O

The    O
city    O
's    O
division    O
into    O

remained    O
in    O
use    O
until    O
7    O
BC    O
,    O
when    O
Augustus    B-Prophet110483530
divided    O
the    O
city    O

episodes    O
he    O
encountered    O
in    O
the    O

but    O
realized    O
that    O
much    O
of    O
the    O
public    O
knew    O
little    O
about    O
Rome    O
outside    O
of    O
Caesar’s    B-Prophet110483530

)    O

He    O
is    O
mainly    O
concerned    O
with    O
the    O
political    O
history    O
of    O
the    O
Roman    O
world    O
in    O
the    O
age    O
of    O
Caesar    B-Prophet110483530

Augustus    B-Prophet110483530
and    O
in    O
the    O
late    O

with    O
the    O
history    O
of    O

Roman    O
historiography    O
.    O

With    O
his    O
death    O
,    O
Rome    O
split    O
between    O
supporters    O
of    O
Mark    B-Prophet110483530
Antony    I-Prophet110483530
and    O
Octavian    B-Prophet110483530
.    O

Octavian    B-Prophet110483530
was    O
quick    O
to    O
declare    O
war    O
on    O
Antony    O
and    O
Cleopatra    O
while    O
public    O
opinion    O
of    O

was    O
low    O

at    O
the    O
hands    O
of    O
Octavian    B-Prophet110483530

Antony    O
attempted    O
suicide    O
by    O
falling    O
on    O
his    O
own    O
sword    O
.    O

Initially    O
these    O
bodies    O
would    O
consist    O
partly    O
of    O
Roman    O
citizens    O
,    O
usually    O
to    O
the    O
number    O
of    O
three    O
hundred    O
;    O
but    O
after    O
Augustus    B-Prophet110483530
the    O
number    O
was    O
increased    O
and    O
thousands    O
of    O
Romans    O
who    O
retired    O
from    O
their    O
legions    O
were    O
granted    O
lands    O
in    O
many    O

in    O
the    O

During    O
the    O
Civil    O
Wars    O
the    O
coasts    O
of    O
Bruttium    O
were    O
repeatedly    O

by    O
the    O
fleets    O
of    O
Sextus    B-Prophet110483530
Pompeius    I-Prophet110483530
,    O
and    O
witnessed    O
several    O
conflicts    O
between    O
the    O
latter    O
and    O
those    O
of    O
Octavian    B-Prophet110483530

by    O
a    O

asked    O
him    O
if    O
it    O

true    O
that    O

belonged    O
to    O
the    O

but    O
the    O
Emperor    B-Prophet110483530

(    O
through    O
his    O

added    O
the    O
oppidum    O
to    O

,    O
which    O
became    O
a    O

province    O
during    O
the    O

the    O

that    O

him    O

before    O
his    O
great    O
sin    O

he    O
was    O
full    O
of    O
confidence    O

that    O
of    O
Absalom    O
was    O
after    O
it    O

is    O
relatively    O
frequently    O
depicted    O
.    O

The    O
title    O
refers    O
to    O
the    O
Biblical    O
story    O
of    O
Absalom    O
,    O
a    O
son    O
of    O
David    B-Prophet110483530
who    O
rebelled    O
against    O
his    O
father    O
(    O
then    O
King    O
of    O
Kingdom    O
of    O
Israel    O
)    O
and    O
who    O
was    O
killed    O
by    O
David    O
's    O
general    O
Joab    O
in    O
violation    O
of    O
David    O
's    O
order    O
to    O
deal    O
gently    O
with    O
his    O
son    O
,    O
causing    O
heartbreak    O
to    O
David    O
.    O

It    O
probably    O
is    O
derived    O
from    O
the    O
Biblical    O
words    O
spoken    O
by    O
David    B-Prophet110483530
after    O

According    O

it    O
was    O
a    O
good    O
thing    O
that    O
others    O
could    O
prophesy    O

The    O
narrative    O
in    O
Joshua    O

that    O
the    O

was    O
taken    O
by    O
the    O

this    O
is    O
contradicted    O
not    O
only    O
by    O

Scipio    B-Prophet110483530

of    O
500    O
men    O
for    O
his    O
personal    O
protection    O
,    O

were    O
often    O
quite    O

The    O
next    O
day    O
,    O
the    O

to    O
break    O
through    O
the    O

held    O
his    O

in    O
reserve    O
,    O
instead    O
spacing    O
them    O
at    O
regular    O
intervals    O
along    O
the    O
wall    O
.    O

In    O
the    O
mid-8th    O
-    O
century    O
,    O
taking    O
advantage    O
of    O
the    O
warring    O
Islamic    O
factions    O
in    O
Palestine    O
,    O

a    O

had    O
turned    O

The    O
genealogical    O

of    O

that    O

is    O

to    O
be    O
the    O
"    O
siser    O
"    O
mentioned    O
by    O

as    O
a    O
favourite    O
of    O
the    O

though    O
this    O
may    O
have    O
also    O
been    O
a    O
reference    O
to    O
a    O
parsnip    O

.    O

This    O
was    O
probably    O
stimulated    O
by    O
the    O
publication    O
in    O
1614    O
of    O
a    O
Dutch    O
translation    O
of    O

in    O

adopted    O
the    O
Roman    O
names    O
"    O
Tiberius    O
Julius    O
"    O
,    O
because    O
he    O
received    O
Roman    O

the    O

to    O
have    O
an    O
ecological    O

Caligula    B-Prophet110483530

this    O

scholars    O
have    O
proposed    O
three    O
hypotheses    O
:    O
that    O
it    O
was    O
written    O
entirely    O
under    O

or    O
under    O
the    O

of    O
both    O
Augustus    O

or    O
entirely    O

Although    O

could    O
claim    O
that    O
his    O

described    O
the    O

of    O

as    O
a    O

a    O

For    O
Christians    O
,    O
Moses    O
is    O
often    O
a    O
symbol    O
of    O
God    O
's    O
law    O
,    O
as    O
reinforced    O
and    O
expounded    O
on    O

of    O

Another    O
author    O
explains    O
,    O
"    O
When    O
Saint    O
Jerome    O
translated    O
the    O
Old    O
Testament    O

,    O
he    O
thought    O
no    O

Christ    B-Prophet110483530
should    O
glow    O
with    O
rays    O
of    O
light    O
—    O
so    O
he    O
advanced    O
the    O
secondary    O
translation    O

Christ    O
became    O
the    O
accepted    O
Christian    O
designation    O
and    O
title    O
of    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
of    I-Prophet110483530
Nazareth    I-Prophet110483530
,    O
because    O
Christians    O
believe    O
that    O
messianic    O
prophecies    O
in    O
the    O
Christian    O
Old    O
Testament    O
were    O
fulfilled    O
in    O
his    O
mission    O
,    O
death    O
,    O

Christian    O
marriages    O
are    O

the    O

The    O
sacrament    O
of    O

is    O
indicative    O
of    O
the    O
relationship    O
between    O

the    O
Church    O

the    O
proscription    O

Mani    O

,    O
Zoroaster    B-Prophet110483530
,    O
and    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
were    O
incomplete    O

that    O
his    O

He    O

most    O
noted    O
for    O
his    O
modifications    O
to    O

The    O
central    O
teachings    O
of    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
are    O
presented    O
in    O
the    O
Sermon    O
on    O
the    O
Mount    O
,    O
notably    O
the    O
"    O
golden    O
rule    O

and    O
the    O
prescription    O
to    O
"    O

above    O
him    O
.    O

He    O
studied    O
the    O
Bible    O
and    O
attended    O
church    O
,    O
but    O
the    O
accounts    O
differ    O
as    O
to    O
whether    O
he    O
determined    O
on    O
his    O
own    O
that    O
there    O
was    O
no    O
existing    O
religion    O
built    O
upon    O
the    O
true    O
teachings    O
of    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
or    O
whether    O
the    O
idea    O
that    O
all    O
churches    O
were    O
false    O
had    O
not    O
"    O
entered    O
his    O
heart    O

until    O
he    O
experienced    O
the    O
vision    O

Although    O
Smith    O
left    O
their    O
identity    O
inexplicit    O
,    O
most    O
Latter    O

Saints    O
infer    O
that    O
these    O

God    O
the    O
Father    O

by    O
her    O

through    O

Other    O

Anglo    O

Catholics    O

most    O

reject    O
the    O
doctrine    O
that    O
Mary    O
was    O
sinless    O
and    O
conceived    O
without    O
original    O
sin    O

often    O
citing    O
that    O
it    O
is    O
not    O
within    O
the    O
Holy    O
Scripture    O

is    O
against    O

According    O
to    O

,    O
the    O

is    O
the    O
advent    O

For    O
Irenaeus    O
,    O
the    O
Incarnation    O
of    O
Christ    B-Prophet110483530
was    O
intended    O
by    O
God    O

for    O
the    O

states    O
that    O

the    O
Jewish    O
Messiah    O

is    O
one    O
of    O
the    O
Three    O
Divine    O
Persons    O
,    O
and    O
that    O
salvation    O
is    O
only    O
achieved    O
through    O
acceptance    O
of    O

The    O
early    O
Christian    O
theologian    O
,    O
Tertullian    O
,    O
wrote    O
that    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
himself    O
was    O
a    O
eunuch    O
(    O
c.    O

)    O
.    O

In    O
1899    O

received    O
a    O

of    O
the    O
crucified    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
Christ    I-Prophet110483530
who    O
urged    O
Wiecka    O
to    O
endure    O
her    O
suffering    O
and    O
defeat    O
it    O
with    O
patience    O
.    O

He    O
had    O
an    O
ardent    O
devotion    O
to    O
the    O
Passion    O
of    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530

But    O
she    O
did    O
not    O

herself    O

the    O

asked    O

This    O

to    O
follow    O
the    O

:    O

were    O
the    O
wearing    O
of    O

as    O

As    O
Christians    O
experienced    O
persecution    O
,    O
they    O
often    O
embraced    O
their    O
fate    O
of    O
suffering    O
due    O
to    O
their    O
love    O
for    O

and    O
the    O
transformation    O
they    O
said    O
they    O
experienced    O
from    O
following    O
him    O
;    O
these    O
individuals    O
became    O
martyrs    O
of    O
the    O
Christian    O
faith    O
.    O

Benn    O
asserted    O

the    O

of    O

Christ    I-Prophet110483530
had    O
a    O
"    O
radical    O
political    O
importance    O
"    O
on    O
his    O
life    O
,    O
and    O
made    O
a    O
distinction    O

by    O
James    O

he    O

the    O
hypothesis    O
that    O
the    O
original    O

movement    O
was    O
a    O
dynastic    O
one    O

with    O
the    O
intention    O
of    O
overthrowing    O
the    O
rule    O
of    O
Herod    O
Antipas    O
;    O
that    O
Jesus    O
of    O
Nazareth    O
was    O
a    O
royal    O
messiah    O
,    O
while    O
his    O
cousin    O
John    O

planned    O
to    O

a    O
priestly    O
messiah    O

the    O
implications    O
of    O
such    O
a    O
decision    O
.    O

He    O
states    O
that    O
he    O
then    O
encountered    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
,    O
who    O
told    O
him    O

argues    O
that    O
the    O
concept    O
of    O

power    O
represents    O
a    O
masculine    O
perception    O
of    O

recovery    O
,    O
such    O
as    O

and    O
that    O
the    O

It    O
is    O
of    O
importance    O
to    O

the    O

The    O
main    O
focus    O
of    O
these    O

is    O
to    O
encourage    O
new    O

As    O
mentioned    O
by    O
Christ    B-Prophet110483530
in    O
the    O
Bible    O
,    O
many    O
will    O
come    O
in    O
the    O
name    O
of    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
and    O
perform    O
miracles    O
,    O
but    O
they    O
are    O
against    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
.    O

There    O
is    O
a    O
lot    O
of    O
difference    O
between    O
practicing    O
Christianity    O
and    O
doing    O
what    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
asked    O
us    O
to    O
do    O
.    O

The    O
question    O
is    O
if    O
he    O
is    O
a    O
practicing    O
Christian    O
,    O
does    O
he    O
practice    O
Christianity    O
or    O
is    O
he    O
a    O
follower    O
of    O
Christ    B-Prophet110483530
?    O
"    O
It    O
is    O
surprising    O
how    O
someone    O
who    O
received    O
a    O
miraculous    O
healing    O
for    O
his    O
son    O
turn    O
against    O

The    O

According    O
to    O
pious    O
legend    O
,    O
St.    O
Bernard    O
asked    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
which    O
was    O
his    O
greatest    O
unrecorded    O
suffering    O
and    O
the    O
wound    O
that    O
inflicted    O
the    O
most    O
pain    O
on    O
him    O
in    O
Calvary    O
and    O
Jesus    O
answered    O
:    O
"    O
I    O
had    O
on    O
My    O
Shoulder    O
,    O
while    O
I    O
bore    O
My    O
Cross    O
on    O
the    O
Way    O
of    O
Sorrows    O
,    O
a    O
grievous    O
Wound    O
which    O
was    O
more    O
painful    O
than    O
the    O

"    O
The    O
Good    O
Shepherd    O
"    O
is    O
a    O
metaphor    O
which    O
refers    O
to    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
as    O
the    O
shepherd    O
who    O
laid    O
down    O

The    O
earliest    O
followers    O
of    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
composed    O
an    O
apocalyptic    O
Jewish    O
sect    O
,    O
which    O
historians    O

to    O

The    O
early    O
Christians    O
in    O
the    O
1st    O
century    O
AD    O
believed    O
Yahweh    O
to    O
be    O
the    O
only    O
true    O
God    O
,    O
the    O
god    O
of    O
Israel    O
,    O
and    O
considered    O
Jesus    O
to    O
be    O
the    O
messiah    O
(    O
Christ    B-Prophet110483530
)    O
prophesied    O
in    O
the    O

scriptures    O

As    O
Cicero    O
lived    O
before    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
,    O
Erasmus    O
saw    O
Cicero    O
's    O
Latin    O
as    O
pagan    O
,    O
and    O
therefore    O
unsuited    O
to    O
translating    O
holy    O
texts    O
.    O

Christianity    O
in    O
the    O
2nd    O

of    O
the    O

were    O

not    O

revenge    O
;    O
he    O
is    O
not    O

the    O

the    O

(    O

)    O
in    O
the    O

,    O
following    O
news    O
that    O
she    O
had    O
performed    O
an    O
engagement    O
ritual    O
with    O

,    O
Satan    O
,    O
visits    O
him    O

times    O
:    O
first    O
as    O
an    O
innocent    O

Mary    O
,    O
mother    O
of    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
of    O

Therefore    O
,    O
according    O
to    O
Nestorian    O
belief    O
,    O
Mary    O
was    O
not    O
the    O
mother    O
of    O
God    O
but    O
only    O
of    O

of    O
Pontius    O
Pilate    O
,    O
where    O
he    O
was    O
condemned    O
to    O

In    O

adapts    O
to    O
his    O
own    O
situation    O
;    O

The    O
administrator    O
of    O
the    O

Theologically    O
,    O
healing    O
is    O
understood    O
in    O
terms    O
of    O
the    O
defeat    O
of    O
evil    O
spirits    O
,    O
often    O
associated    O
with    O
witchcraft    O
,    O
by    O
the    O
power    O
of    O
Christ    B-Prophet110483530
;    O
this    O
pacification    O
of    O
spirits    O
allows    O
some    O
converts    O
to    O
remove    O
themselves    O
from    O
cycles    O
of    O
social    O
aggression    O
associated    O
with    O
witchcraft    O
accusations    O
.    O

In    O
contrast    O

,    O
Kaylor    O
argues    O
that    O
Jesus    B-Prophet110483530
was    O
a    O
social    O
reformer    O
who    O
was    O

a    O
desire    O

The    O
right    O
-    O

a    O

The    O
symbolic    O
significance    O
of    O
the    O

to    O
both    O

shortly    O
after    O
Marcus    O

as    O
consul    O
,    O
Julius    B-Prophet110483530
Caesar    I-Prophet110483530
urged    O
Titus    O

,    O
a    O

who    O
had    O
lost    O
his    O

during    O
the    O

house    O
had    O
spoken    O
in    O
favor    O

the    O
culprits    O
,    O
Julius    B-Prophet110483530
Caesar    I-Prophet110483530
swayed    O
many    O
by    O
suggesting    O
that    O
they    O
should    O
be    O
exiled    O
to    O
various    O
Italian    O
cities    O
until    O

's    O
consulate    O
in    O
59    O
BC    O
,    O
he    O
helped    O
Publius    O
Clodius    O
Pulcher    O
into    O
the    O
office    O
of    O

off    O

During    O
his    O
last    O
years    O
in    O
Gaul    O
,    O
Caesar    B-Prophet110483530
rightly    O
feared    O
the    O
senate    O
might    O
put    O
him    O
to    O
trial    O
for    O
his    O
breaches    O
of    O

Among    O
them    O
,    O
one    O
of    O
the    O
strongest    O
opponents    O
was    O
Julius    B-Prophet110483530
Caesar    I-Prophet110483530
,    O
who    O
did    O
not    O
put    O
the    O
decree    O
into    O
question    O
altogether    O
,    O
but    O
its    O
ability    O
to    O
override    O
the    O
popular    O
rights    O
of    O

By    O
that    O
time    O
,    O
the    O
world    O
will    O
be    O
powered    O
by    O

there    O

be    O
a    O

led    O
by    O
a    O

the    O
reincarnation    O
of    O

completely    O

but    O
it    O
follows    O
an    O
iconographic    O
type    O
which    O
is    O
more    O
closely    O
associated    O
with    O

,    O
Brutus    O
the    O
assassin    O
of    O
Caesar    B-Prophet110483530
is    O
depicted    O
as    O
a    O
man    O
who    O
has    O
always    O
believed    O
in    O
honor    O
,    O
virtue    O
and    O
liberty    O
and    O
who    O
has    O
ultimately    O
sacrificed    O
everything    O

ideals    O

also    O

The    O
technique    O
was    O
so    O
named    O
because    O
,    O
though    O
its    O
presence    O
is    O
attested    O
in    O
protohistoric    O
times    O
,    O
its    O
use    O
was    O
common    O
enough    O
in    O
Gaul    O
to    O
merit    O
mention    O
in    O
Julius    B-Prophet110483530
Caesar's    I-Prophet110483530

life    O
and    O
the    O
bloody    O
chapter    O
that    O
ensued    O
are    O
roughly    O
comparable    O
to    O
the    O
end    O
of    O

was    O
large    O

Domitian    B-Prophet110483530
decided    O

has    O
been    O
taken    O
with    O
suspicion    O
by    O

The    O
"    O

"    O
opens    O
with    O
a    O
priamel    O
in    O
which    O
the    O
poet    O
rejects    O
several    O
themes    O
dealing    O
with    O
Theban    O
mythology    O
and    O
decides    O
to    O
focus    O
on    O

(    O

following    O
this    O

Belief    O
in    O
the    O

principle    O
of    O

mentioned    O
in    O
some    O
of    O
Muhammad    B-Prophet110483530

sayings    O
when    O
he    O
said    O
for    O

:    O
"    O
I    O
have    O
received    O
five    O
gifts    O
from    O

,    O
[    O
one    O
of    O
which    O
]    O
is    O

of    O
intercession    O

which    O
I    O
have    O
in    O
store    O
for    O
my    O

'    O

The    O

In    O

the    O
rules    O

standards    O
