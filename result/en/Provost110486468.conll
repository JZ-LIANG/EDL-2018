homosexuality    O

a    O

Bernard    B-Provost110486468

argues    O
that    O

abstracting    O
persons    O

Kant    O
misrepresents    O

Philippa    O

identified    O
Kant    O
as    O
one    O
of    O
a    O
select    O
group    O
of    O

for    O
the    O

by    O
analytic    O
philosophy    O
.    O

Immanuel    O
Kant    O
and    O
his    O
followers    O
held    O
that    O
shame    O
is    O
heteronomous    O
(    O
comes    O
from    O
others    O
)    O
