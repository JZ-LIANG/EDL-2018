This    O

In    O
some    O
aspects    O
it    O
was    O
advanced    O
for    O
its    O
day    O
,    O
particularly    O
in    O
its    O
use    O

efficient    O
than    O
a    O
cylinder    O

system    O
because    O
it    O
reduces    O

from    O
the    O
transformation    O

The    O
engine    O
received    O
new    O
piston    B-Pump104021798

lowered    O

A    O

It    O
is    O
also    O
characterised    O
by    O
its    O

Adiabatic    O
heating    O
occurs    O
when    O
the    O
pressure    O
of    O
a    O
gas    O
is    O
increased    O
from    O
work    O
done    O
on    O
it    O
by    O
its    O
surroundings    O
,    O
e.g.    O
,    O
a    O
piston    B-Pump104021798
compressing    O
a    O
gas    O
contained    O
within    O
a    O
cylinder    O
and    O
raising    O
the    O
temperature    O
where    O
in    O
many    O
practical    O
situations    O
heat    O
conduction    O
through    O
walls    O
can    O
be    O
slow    O
compared    O
with    O
the    O
compression    O
time    O
.    O

This    O
coating    O
allowed    O
aluminium    O
cylinders    O
