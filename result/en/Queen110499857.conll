Gandhari    B-Queen110499857

Dhritarashtra    O
marries    O
Gandhari    B-Queen110499857
,    O
a    O
princess    O
from    O
Gandhara    O
,    O
who    O
blindfolds    O
herself    O
so    O
that    O
she    O
may    O
feel    O
the    O
pain    O
that    O
her    O
husband    O
feels    O
.    O

Dhritarashtra    O
has    O
a    O
hundred    O
sons    O
through    O
Gandhari    B-Queen110499857

all    O
born    O

to    O
a    O
similar    O

Another    O
twist    O
is    O
that    O
Gandhari    B-Queen110499857

described    O
as    O
antagonistic    O
character    O
who    O
hates    O
the    O
Pandavas    O
:    O
her    O
hate    O
is    O
out    O
of    O
jealousy    O
because    O
during    O
Gandhari    O
's    O
swayamvara    O
,    O
she    O
was    O
in    O

d    O
to    O

brother    O
instead    O
,    O
whom    O
she    O
did    O
not    O
love    O
,    O
so    O
she    O
blindfolded    O
herself    O
as    O
protest    O
.    O

Bhima    O
is    O
generally    O
credited    O
with    O
killing    O
all    O
sons    O
of    O
Dhritrashtra    O
and    O
Gandhari    B-Queen110499857
.    O

He    O
is    O
then    O
told    O
that    O
,    O
since    O
his    O
mother    O
,    O
Gandhari    B-Queen110499857
had    O
an    O
astrological    O
defect    O

This    O
fight    O
among    O
