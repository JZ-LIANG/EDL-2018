The    O
term    O
is    O
used    O
for    O
infrastructure    O
on    O
and    O
under    O
the    O
river    O
,    O
such    O
as    O
the    O
North    O

piers    O

In    O
1909    O
,    O
construction    O
of    O
two    O
tunnel    O
projects    O
was    O
under    O
way    O
:    O
one    O
was    O
called    O
the    O
North    B-RailroadTunnel104048441
River    I-RailroadTunnel104048441
Tunnels    I-RailroadTunnel104048441
,    O
the    O
other    O
,    O
the    O
Hudson    O
Tubes    O
.    O

Prior    O
to    O
the    O
opening    O
of    O
the    O
North    B-RailroadTunnel104048441
River    I-RailroadTunnel104048441
Tunnels    I-RailroadTunnel104048441
and    O
the    O
Hudson    O
and    O
Manhattan    O
Railroad    O
tubes    O
in    O
the    O
early    O
1900s    O
,    O
passengers    O
and    O
freight    O
were    O
required    O
to    O
cross    O
the    O
river    O
for    O
travel    O
to    O
points    O
east    O
.    O

The    O
reason    O
for    O
this    O
was    O
that    O
all    O
trains    O
going    O
to    O
points    O
north    O
of    O
the    O
station    O
were    O
required    O
to    O
be    O
diesel    O
-    O
powered    O
,    O
while    O
trains    O
going    O
to    O
New    O
York    O
Penn    O
Station    O
are    O
all    O
electric    O
because    O
of    O
problems    O
with    O
diesel    O
fumes    O
in    O
the    O
tunnels    B-RailroadTunnel104048441
under    I-RailroadTunnel104048441
the    I-RailroadTunnel104048441
Hudson    I-RailroadTunnel104048441
River    I-RailroadTunnel104048441
.    O

The    O
improvement    O
would    O
have    O
included    O
the    O
construction    O
of    O
two    O
new    O
rail    O
tunnels    O
under    O
the    O
Hudson    O
River    O
as    O
a    O
supplement    O
to    O

which    O
operate    O
at    O
100%    O

the    O
construction    O
