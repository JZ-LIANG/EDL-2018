various    O

is    O

the    O
majority    O

recognize    O
five    O
additional    O
sacraments    O
:    O

the    O

risks    O

that    O

refusing    O

because    O
of    O

Originally    O
an    O
evangelical    O

Dale    O
came    O
to    O
believe    O
that    O

specifically    O
appropriate    O
to    O

with    O
the    O
American    O
Board    O
of    O

into    O
use    O
in    O
the    O

By    O
1898    O
,    O
Creighton    O
was    O
increasingly    O
occupied    O
with    O
a    O
debate    O
over    O
ritual    B-ReligiousCeremony101028082
practice    I-ReligiousCeremony101028082
in    O
the    O
Diocese    O
of    O
London    O
,    O
and    O
,    O
more    O
generally    O
,    O
in    O
the    O
Church    O
of    O
England    O
.    O

Among    O
his    O
other    O
clerical    O

great    O

uncle    O
,    O
Edward    O

,    O
who    O
was    O
Bishop    O
of    O
Lincoln    O
from    O
1885    O
to    O
1910    O
and    O
was    O
famously    O
prosecuted    O
for    O
ritualistic    B-ReligiousCeremony101028082
practices    I-ReligiousCeremony101028082
.    O

Forecourts    O
were    O
probably    O
the    O
venue    O
for    O
ritual    B-ReligiousCeremony101028082
practices    O
connected    O
with    O
the    O
burial    O
and    O
commemoration    O
of    O
the    O
dead    O
in    O
the    O

A    O
late    O
account    O
by    O
Rudolph    O
de    O

refers    O
to    O

'    O
encounter    O
with    O
the    O
Blessed    O
Virgin    O
Mary    O

Authority    O
to    O
so    O
administer    O
such    O
sacraments    O
is    O
passed    O
on    O
only    O
through    O
the    O
sacrament    O
of    O
Holy    B-ReligiousCeremony101028082
Orders    I-ReligiousCeremony101028082
,    O
a    O

a    O

be    O
conferred    O
only    O
by    O
bishop    O
)    O
.    O

This    O
is    O
because    O
Wesley    O
believed    O
that    O
the    O
offices    O
of    O
bishop    O
and    O
presbyter    O
constituted    O
one    O
order    B-ReligiousCeremony101028082
,    O
citing    O
an    O
ancient    O
opinion    O
from    O
the    O
Church    O
of    O
Alexandria    O
;    O
Jerome    O
,    O
a    O
Church    O

,    O
wrote    O
:    O
"    O
For    O
even    O
at    O
Alexandria    O
from    O

time    O

of    O

own    O
number    O
chosen    O
by    O
themselves    O
and    O
set    O
in    O
a    O
more    O
exalted    O
position    O

elects    O

as    O
deacons    O

one    O
of    O
themselves    O
whom    O
they    O
know    O
to    O
be    O
diligent    O

him    O

tradition—    O

some    O
Lutherans    O
.    O

He    O
taught    O
that    O
there    O
is    O
one    O
Church    O
,    O
but    O
that    O
within    O
this    O

there    O
are    O
two    O
realities    O
,    O
namely    O
,    O
the    O

aspect    O

the    O

the    O
invisible    O
(    O
the    O

are    O
either    O
dead    O

elect    O
predestined    O
for    O
Heaven    O

.    O

They    O
see    O
it    O
as    O
one    O
of    O
four    O
elements    O
that    O
define    O
the    O
true    O
Church    O
of    O

and    O
legitimize    O
the    O

in    O

he    O

as    O
the    O
grandfather    O
of    O
the    O

the    O
Tridentine    B-ReligiousCeremony101028082

the    O
priest    O
joins    O
his    O
hands    O
while    O
saying    O
the    O
word    O
"    O
Sanctus    O
"    O
and    O
then    O
,    O
bowing    O
,    O
continues    O
to    O
recite    O
the    O
whole    O
of    O
the    O
Sanctus    O
in    O
a    O
lower    O
voice    O
,    O
while    O
a    O

bell    O
is    O
rung    O
;    O
then    O
,    O
on    O
reaching    O
the    O
words    O
"    O
Benedictus    O
qui    O
venit    O
in    O
nomine    O
Domini    O
"    O
,    O

makes    O
the    O

of    O
the    O

.    O

He    O
has    O
called    O
"    O
the    O
height    O
of    O
asininity    O
"    O
the    O
argument    O
that    O
the    O
use    O
of    O
Latin    O
in    O
the    O
Tridentine    B-ReligiousCeremony101028082
Mass    I-ReligiousCeremony101028082
is    O
an    O
approach    O
to    O
mystery    O
better    O
than    O
the    O
use    O
of    O
the    O
vernacular    O
language    O
in    O
the    O
modern    O
Mass    B-ReligiousCeremony101028082
He    O
is    O
a    O
supporter    O
of    O
the    O
synodal    O
form    O
of    O
church    O
administration    O
,    O
followed    O
by    O
the    O
Eastern    O

,    O
for    O
the    O
entire    O

to    O

to    O

him    O
for    O
eternity    O
,    O
but    O
withheld    O
the    O

accused    O

studying    O
with    O
a    O

Another    O
factor    O
may    O
have    O
been    O
that    O
kissing    O
the    O
pax    O
had    O
clearly    O
come    O

exactly    O
what    O

typically    O
when    O
two    O

more    O
denominations    O
are    O
in    O
full    O

As    O
a    O
practical    O
matter    O
for    O
most    O
Catholics    O

means    O

partake    O

essential    O
condition    O
for    O
sharing    O
together    O

there    O
was    O
a    O
change    O

Doctrinal    O
disputes    O
arose    O
between    O
Villegaignon    O
and    O
the    O
Calvinists    O
,    O
especially    O
in    O
relation    O
to    O
the    O
Eucharist    B-ReligiousCeremony101028082
,    O
and    O
in    O
October    O
1557    O
the    O
Calvinists    O
were    O
banished    O
from    O
Coligny    O
island    O
as    O
a    O
result    O
.    O

The    O
agenda    O
was    O
not    O
well    O
received    O
by    O
many    O
Lutherans    O
,    O
as    O
it    O
was    O
seen    O
to    O
compromise    O
in    O
the    O
wording    O
of    O
the    O
Words    O
of    O
Institution    O
,    O
to    O
the    O
point    O
where    O
the    O
Real    O
Presence    O
of    O
Christ    O
in    O
the    O
Eucharist    B-ReligiousCeremony101028082
was    O
not    O
proclaimed    O
.    O

The    O
liturgical    O
agenda    O
was    O
subsequently    O
modified    O
to    O
appease    O
many    O
of    O
the    O
objections    O
of    O
the    O
dissenting    O
Lutherans    O
,    O
and    O
in    O
1830    O
Frederick    O
William    O
ordered    O
all    O
Protestant    O
congregations    O
in    O
Prussia    O
to    O
celebrate    O
the    O
Lord's    B-ReligiousCeremony101028082

the    O
