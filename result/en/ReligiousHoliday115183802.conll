Historically    O
the    O

over    O
the    O

150    O

Also    O
the    O

the    O
1960s    O

During    O

seasons    O
(    O
Advent    O

at    O
Christmas    O
would    O

join    O
her    O
in    O

to    O
this    O
day    O

many    O
of    O

In    O
modern    O
Christian    O
practice    O
,    O
Lent    B-ReligiousHoliday115183802
consists    O
of    O

The    O
SIA    O
generates    O
scholarship    O
on    O
Christianity    O
in    O
Africa    O
,    O
operating    O
on    O
the    O
premise    O
that    O
Christianity    O
is    O
a    O
native    O
African    O
religion    O
and    O
has    O
survived    O
there    O
uninterrupted    O
since    O
its    O
inception    O
during    O
Pentecost    B-ReligiousHoliday115183802
.    O

For    O
example    O
,    O
the    O
mosaics    O
of    O
the    O
central    O
dome    O
almost    O
invariably    O
represent    O
one    O
of    O
three    O
scenes    O
:    O
the    O
Ascension    B-ReligiousHoliday115183802
,    O
Pentecost    B-ReligiousHoliday115183802
,    O
or    O
Christ    O
Pantocrator    O
.    O

On    O
Pentecost    B-ReligiousHoliday115183802
1693    O
,    O
Jeanne    O
encountered    O
a    O
poor    O
widow    O
and    O
pilgrim    O
from    O
Rennes    O
,    O
named    O
Francoise    O
Fouchet    O
,    O
who    O
predicted    O
that    O
Jeanne    O
would    O
one    O
day    O
spend    O
her    O
life    O
in    O
care    O
for    O
the    O
poor    O
.    O

However    O
,    O
she    O
was    O
eventually    O
declared    O
a    O
saint    O
