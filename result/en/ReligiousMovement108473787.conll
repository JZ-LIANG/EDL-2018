,    O
the    O
underlying    O
distinction    O
between    O

is    O
foreign    O
to    O

is    O
one    O
form    O
of    O
the    O
dualism    O

that    O
has    O
its    O
origin    O
in    O

to    O
Wilbur    O
(    O

it    O
was    O
his    O
strong    O
stance    O
against    O
the    O
worship    O
of    O
and    O
prayer    O
to    O
Christ    O
that    O
brought    O
a    O

the    O

when    O

rejected    O
all    O

Karaite    B-ReligiousMovement108473787
Judaism    I-ReligiousMovement108473787
defines    O
itself    O

the    O
remnants    O
of    O

sects    O

Around    O
the    O
1st    O
century    O
CE    O
,    O
there    O
were    O
several    O
small    O

:    O

and    O
Christians    B-ReligiousMovement108473787
.    O

The    O
Sadducees    B-ReligiousMovement108473787
rejected    O
the    O
divine    O
inspiration    O
of    O
the    O
Prophets    O
and    O
the    O
Writings    O
,    O
relying    O
only    O
on    O
the    O
Torah    O
as    O
divinely    O
inspired    O
.    O

During    O
the    O
reign    O
of    O
Alexander    O
the    O
Sanhedrin    O
consisted    O
almost    O
entirely    O
of    O
Sadducees    B-ReligiousMovement108473787
;    O
nevertheless    O
he    O
succeeded    O
in    O

the    O
Sadducean    O
members    O

in    O
replacing    O
them    O
with    O
Pharisees    O

So    O
Hyrcanus    O
was    O
believed    O
to    O
be    O
supported    O
by    O
the    O

There    O
the    O

was    O
made    O
ritually    O
unclean    O

was    O
then    O

directly    O

the    O

performed    O

ceremony    O
should    O
be    O

the    O

demonstrated    O
his    O

of    O

they    O
wanted    O
it    O

is    O
that    O

remove    O
the    O

,    O
however    O
he    O
wanted    O
to    O
keep    O
the    O
same    O
eightfold    O
structure    O
and    O
thus    O
needed    O
to    O
create    O
four    O
new    O
sayings    O
.    O
