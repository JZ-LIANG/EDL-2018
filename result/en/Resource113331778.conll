recognizes    O
three    O

referred    O

and    O

Beck    O
,    O
however    O
,    O
has    O
argued    O
that    O
the    O
distribution    O
of    O
this    O
sort    O
of    O
risk    O
is    O
the    O

rather    O
than    O
wealth    O
.    O

Scarcity    O
means    O
that    O

insufficient    O
to    O
satisfy    O

Douglas    O
disagreed    O
with    O
classical    O
economists    O
who    O
recognised    O
only    O
three    O

Supply    O
is    O
normally    O
more    O
elastic    O
in    O
the    O
long    O
run    O
than    O
in    O
the    O
short    O
run    O
for    O
produced    O
goods    O
,    O
since    O
it    O
is    O
generally    O
assumed    O
that    O
in    O
the    O
long    O
run    O
all    O
factors    B-Resource113331778
of    I-Resource113331778
production    I-Resource113331778
can    O
be    O
utilised    O
to    O
increase    O
supply    O
,    O
whereas    O
in    O
the    O
short    O
run    O
only    O
labor    O
can    O
be    O
increased    O
,    O
and    O
even    O
then    O
,    O
changes    O
may    O
be    O
prohibitively    O
costly    O

It    O

(    O

Some    O
mixotrophic    O
microorganisms    O
use    O
osmotrophy    O
to    O
derive    O
energy    B-Resource113331778

In    O
stagnant    O
waters    O
photoautotrophs    O
has    O
a    O
relative    O
advantage    O
over    O
heterotrophic    O
osmotrophs    O
since    O
the    O
flux    O
of    O
photon    O
as    O
energy    B-Resource113331778
source    O
is    O
not    O
hindered    O
at    O
low    O
temperatures    O

,    O
it    O
depend    O
on    O

through    O

This    O
