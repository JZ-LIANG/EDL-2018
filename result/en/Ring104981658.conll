sensed    O

immediately    O

even    O
though    O

's    O
secondary    O
plot    O
concerning    O
the    O
resurgence    O
of    O
Sauron    O
.    O

During    O
the    O
War    O
of    O
the    O
Ring    O
,    O
a    O
messenger    O
from    O
Mordor    O
twice    O
came    O
to    O
Erebor    O
,    O
asking    O
for    O
assistance    O
in    O
finding    O
the    O
One    B-Ring104981658
Ring    I-Ring104981658

offering    O
three    O

the    O
seven    O
Dwarf    O
rings    O
and    O
Moria    O
,    O
but    O
D√°in    O
refused    O
.    O

Reasons    O
for    O
this    O
trek    O
are    O
unknown    O
,    O
but    O
they    O
possibly    O
had    O
to    O
do    O
with    O
Sauron    O
's    O
growing    O
power    O
in    O
nearby    O
Greenwood    O
,    O
which    O
later    O
became    O
known    O
as    O
Mirkwood    O
as    O
a    O
result    O
of    O
the    O
shadow    O
that    O
fell    O
upon    O
it    O
during    O
Sauron    O
's    O
search    O
of    O
the    O
forest    O
for    O
the    O
One    B-Ring104981658
Ring    I-Ring104981658
.    O

They    O
were    O
nine    O
men    O
who    O
succumbed    O
to    O
Sauron    O
's    O
power    O
and    O
attained    O
near    O
-    O
immortality    O
as    O
wraiths    O
,    O
servants    O
bound    O

power    O
of    O
the    O

and    O
completely    O
under    O
the    O
dominion    O
of    O
Sauron    O
.    O

Ultimately    O
,    O
however    O
,    O
they    O
were    O
bound    O
to    O
the    O
One    B-Ring104981658
Ring    I-Ring104981658

completely    O

The    O
most    O
common    O
in    O
the    O
cattle    O
industry    O
are    O
macrocyclic    O
lactones    O
,    O
which    O
include    O
ivermectin    O
and    O
eprinomectin    O
,    O
benzimidazole    B-Ring104981658
,    O
and    O
imidazothiazoles    O
are    O
also    O
used    O
to    O
a    O
lesser    O
extent    O
.    O

This    O
effect    O
may    O
be    O
due    O
to    O
the    O
strong    O
coordination    O
between    O
benzimidazole    B-Ring104981658
and    O
the    O
central    O
cobalt    O
atom    O

Another    O
class    O

As    O
a    O

the    O

are    O
a    O
system    O
of    O
rings    O
around    O
the    O
planet    O
Uranus    O
,    O
intermediate    O
in    O

between    O
the    O
more    O
extensive    O
set    O
around    O

systems    O
around    O

and    O
Neptune    B-Ring104981658
.    O

Uranus    O
's    O
ring    O
system    O
was    O
the    O
second    O
to    O
be    O
discovered    O
in    O
the    O

System    O
,    O
after    O
that    O
of    O
Saturn    B-Ring104981658
.    O

However    O
,    O
they    O
can    O
not    O
be    O
made    O
of    O
pure    O
water    O
ice    O
like    O
the    O
rings    B-Ring104981658
of    I-Ring104981658
Saturn    I-Ring104981658
because    O
they    O
are    O
too    O
dark    O
,    O
darker    O
than    O
the    O
inner    O

of    O

As    O
a    O
whole    O
,    O
the    O
ring    O
system    O
of    O
Uranus    O
is    O
unlike    O
either    O
the    O
faint    O

rings    B-Ring104981658

,    O
some    O

which    O
are    O
composed    O
of    O
very    O
bright    O
material    O
‚Äî    O
water    O

.    O

However    O
,    O
there    O
are    O
similarities    O
with    O
some    O
parts    O
of    O
the    O
latter    O
ring    O
system    O
;    O
the    O
Saturnian    O
F    B-Ring104981658
ring    I-Ring104981658
and    O
the    O
Uranian    O
Œµ    O
ring    O
are    O
both    O
narrow    O
,    O
relatively    O
dark    O
and    O
are    O
shepherded    O
by    O
a    O
pair    O
of    O
moons    O
.    O

At    O
their    O
densest    O
,    O
they    O
are    O
comparable    O
to    O
the    O
less    O
dense    O
portions    O
of    O
Saturn's    B-Ring104981658
main    I-Ring104981658

such    O
as    O
the    O
C    O
ring    O
and    O
the    O

Division    O
,    O
but    O
much    O
of    O
Neptune    O
's    O
ring    O
system    O
is    O
quite    O
tenuous    O
,    O
faint    O
and    O
dusty    O
,    O
more    O
closely    O
resembling    O

of    I-Ring104981658
Jupiter    I-Ring104981658
.    O

In    O
this    O
respect    O
they    O
are    O
similar    O
to    O
the    O
rings    B-Ring104981658
of    I-Ring104981658

are    O
