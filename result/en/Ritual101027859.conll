The    O

during    O

following    O
Tsunetomo    O
's    O
death    O
,    O
but    O
by    O
the    O
1930s    O
it    O
had    O
become    O
one    O
of    O
the    O
most    O
famous    O
representatives    O
of    O

taught    O
in    O
Japan    O
.    O

Some    O
Chinese    O
and    O
Korean    O
thinkers    O
believed    O
that    O
Wang    O
Yangming    O
's    O
teachings    O
strongly    O
influenced    O
the    O
development    O
of    O

in    O
Japan    O
,    O
and    O
promoted    O
both    O
ethics    O
in    O
their    O
countries    O
to    O
strengthen    O
the    O
spirit    O
of    O
their    O
respective    O
peoples    O
.    O

This    O
was    O
probably    O
due    O
to    O
his    O
real    O
-    O
life    O
combat    O

;    O
although    O
in    O
his    O
later    O

of    O

A    O
late    O

to    O

Authority    O
to    O
so    O
administer    O
such    O
sacraments    O
is    O
passed    O
on    O
only    O
through    O

of    O

a    O

a    O

be    O
conferred    O
only    O
by    O

)    O
.    O

This    O
is    O
because    O
Wesley    O
believed    O
that    O
the    O
offices    O
of    O
bishop    O
and    O
presbyter    O
constituted    O
one    O
order    B-Ritual101027859
,    O
citing    O
an    O
ancient    O
opinion    O
from    O
the    O
Church    O
of    O
Alexandria    O
;    O
Jerome    O
,    O
a    O
Church    O
Father    O
,    O
wrote    O
:    O
"    O
For    O

Alexandria    O
from    O

time    O
of    O

Evangelist    O
until    O

of    O

of    O
their    O
own    O
number    O
chosen    O
by    O

and    O
set    O
in    O
a    O

know    O
to    O
be    O

him    O

Although    O
it    O
is    O
not    O
considered    O
a    O
sacrament    O
like    O
baptism    O
and    O
the    O

it    O
is    O
known    O
as    O
a    O

The    O
use    O
of    O
ritual    O
in    O

a    O

nature    O

likely    O
an    O
ancient    O

because    O

to    O

but    O
withheld    O

treatise    O
,    O
written    O

defend    O
the    O
adoration    O
of    O
the    O

of    O
Christ    O

Then    O
the    O
pilgrims    O
reach    O
an    O
inn    O
,    O
where    O
a    O
police    O
sergeant    O
and    O
a    O
priest    O
are    O
discussing    O
the    O
nature    O
of    O
the    O
eucharist    B-Ritual101027859
and    O
whether    O
the    O
body    O
of    O

enters    O
it    O
by    O

There    O
they    O

them    O

in    O
an    O
attempt    O
to    O
get    O
them    O
to    O
deny    O
the    O

beliefs    O
on    O

The    O
Eucharist    B-Ritual101027859

the    O
sacrament    O
of    O

another    O
in    O
the    O

On    O
her    O
fifth    O
birthday    O

she    O
requested    O
to    O
receive    O
Holy    B-Ritual101027859

;    O
however    O
the    O
custom    O
at    O
the    O
time    O
was    O
that    O
children    O
did    O
not    O
receive    O
their    O
First    O
Holy    O
Communion    O
until    O
age    O
14    O
.    O

Her    O
first    O
conflict    O
with    O
church    O
and    O
state    O
came    O
after    O
she    O
spoke    O
against    O
the    O
sacrament    B-Ritual101027859
of    I-Ritual101027859
the    I-Ritual101027859

,    O
but    O
she    O
was    O
released    O
from    O
imprisonment    O
by    O
a    O
commissary    O
of    O
Thomas    O

As    O
soon    O
as    O
she    O
arrived    O
she    O
began    O
preparing    O
for    O
her    O
First    B-Ritual101027859
Communion    I-Ritual101027859
and    O
it    O
was    O
proposed    O
to    O
her    O
that    O
she    O
make    O
her    O

her    O
first    O
reception    O

There    O
were    O
two    O
doors    O
in    O
it    O
,    O
by    O
which    O
clergy    O
could    O
access    O
the    O
nave    O
from    O
the    O
high    O
choir    O
(    O
e.g.    O
for    O
distributing    O
communion    B-Ritual101027859
)    O
.    O

They    O
symbolise    O
the    O
presence    O
of    O
the    O
saints    O
at    O
the    O
Eucharist    B-Ritual101027859

she    O
was    O
fourteen    O
she    O

of    O
her    O

and    O
lived    O
near    O
a    O
devout    O
Catholic    O
family    O
who    O
took    O
them    O
to    O
Mass.    O
Both    O
Carboni    O
and    O
her    O
sister    O
began    O
attending    O
church    O
and    O
studying    O
with    O
a    O
priest    O
,    O
who    O
secretly    O
gave    O
them    O
the    O
sacrament    O
of    O
Holy    B-Ritual101027859
Communion    I-Ritual101027859

confirmation    O
.    O

His    O
parents    O
,    O
devout    O
Roman    O
Catholics    O
,    O
brought    O
their    O
son    O
up    O
in    O
the    O

faith    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
young    O
Belcourt    O
received    O
his    O
first    O
Holy    B-Ritual101027859
Communion    I-Ritual101027859
in    O
1814    O

She    O
received    O

her    O
death    O

Each    O
work    O
reflects    O
the    O
symbolism    O
of    O
life    O
,    O
death    O
and    O
resurrection    O
,    O

About    O
the    O

time    O

in    O

at    O

He    O
was    O
reprimanded    O
for    O
certain    O
"    O
irregularities    O

"    O

offering    O

Presbyterians    O
outside    O

Synod    O
's    O
jurisdiction    O
.    O

He    O
returned    O
later    O
and    O
tried    O
to    O
hold    O
a    O
communion    B-Ritual101027859
but    O
the    O
service    O
was    O
interrupted    O
and    O
he    O
was    O
arrested    O
briefly    O
.    O

Justin    O

,    O
an    O
earlier    O
2nd    O
century    O
Church    O
Father    O
,    O
agreed    O
that    O
the    O
similarities    O
existed    O
,    O
claiming    O
that    O
Mithraism    O
had    O
copied    O

.    O

Among    O
other    O
things    O
,    O
they    O
were    O
united    O
in    O
the    O
belief    O
that    O
Jesus    O
is    O
the    O
Christ    O
,    O
the    O
Son    O
of    O
God    O

on    O
the    O
first    O
day    O
of    O
each    O
week    O
;    O
and    O
that    O
baptism    O
of    O
adult    O
believers    O
by    O
immersion    O
in    O
water    O
is    O

In    O
Anglican    O
or    O
Roman    O
Catholic    O
churches    O
,    O
this    O
ceremony    O
is    O
often    O

form    O
of    O

Wagstaffe    O
passed    O
much    O
of    O
the    O
rest    O
of    O
his    O
days    O
in    O
Warwickshire    O
,    O
but    O
was    O
present    O
when    O
holy    B-Ritual101027859
communion    I-Ritual101027859
was    O
given    O
to    O
John    O

on    O
his    O
deathbed    O
in    O
London    O
in    O
1695    O
.    O

Another    O
factor    O
may    O
have    O
been    O
that    O
kissing    O
the    O
pax    O
had    O
clearly    O
come    O
to    O
act    O
as    O
a    O
substitute    O
for    O
receiving    O
the    O
Eucharist    B-Ritual101027859
for    O
many    O
of    O
the    O
faithful    O
,    O
avoiding    O
the    O
need    O
for    O

other    O
prescribed    O
preparations    O
for    O

Views    O
vary    O
among    O
denominations    O
on    O
exactly    O
what    O
constitutes    O
full    O
communion    O
,    O
but    O
typically    O
when    O
two    O
or    O
more    O
denominations    O
are    O
in    O
full    O
communion    O
it    O
enables    O
services    O
and    O
celebrations    O
,    O
such    O
as    O
the    O
Eucharist    B-Ritual101027859
,    O
to    O
be    O
shared    O
among    O
congregants    O

of    O
any    O
of    O
them    O
with    O
the    O
full    O

As    O
a    O
practical    O
matter    O
for    O
most    O
Catholics    O
,    O
full    O
communion    O
means    O
that    O
a    O
member    O
of    O
one    O
Church    O
may    O
partake    O
of    O
the    O
Eucharist    B-Ritual101027859
celebrated    O
in    O
another    O
,    O
and    O
for    O
priests    O
,    O
that    O
they    O
may    O
concelebrate    O
the    O
Eucharist    O
with    O
priests    O
of    O
another    O
Church    O

In    O
fact    O
,    O
apart    O
from    O
exceptional    O
circumstances    O
,    O
the    O
Catholic    O
Church    O
sees    O
full    O
communion    O
as    O
an    O
essential    O
condition    O
for    O
sharing    O
together    O
in    O
the    O

witnessed    O
to    O

there    O
was    O
a    O
change    O
in    O

between    O

,    O
especially    O
in    O

and    O
in    O

1557    O
the    O
Calvinists    O
were    O
banished    O
from    O
Coligny    O
island    O
as    O
a    O
result    O
.    O

The    O
agenda    O
was    O
not    O
well    O
received    O
by    O
many    O
Lutherans    O
,    O
as    O
it    O
was    O
seen    O
to    O
compromise    O
in    O
the    O
wording    O
of    O
the    O
Words    O
of    O
Institution    O
,    O

in    O

not    O
proclaimed    O

The    O
liturgical    O
agenda    O
was    O
subsequently    O
modified    O
to    O
appease    O
many    O
of    O
the    O
objections    O
of    O
the    O
dissenting    O
Lutherans    O
,    O
and    O
in    O
1830    O
Frederick    O
William    O
ordered    O
all    O
Protestant    O
congregations    O
in    O
Prussia    O
to    O
celebrate    O
the    O
Lord's    B-Ritual101027859

the    O

agenda    O

This    O
event    O
is    O
traditionally    O

Certain    O
