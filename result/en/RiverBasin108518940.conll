Some    O
archaeologists    O
have    O
deduced    O
that    O
the    O
royal    O
Partick    O
estate    O
was    O
part    O
of    O
a    O
larger    O
elite    O
centre    O
of    O
the    O
kingdom    O
,    O
which    O
included    O
the    O
ecclesiastical    O
establishment    O
just    O
across    O

Govan    O
.    O

During    O
the    O
nineteenth    O
century    O
Partick    O
developed    O
from    O
a    O
small    O
village    O
into    O
a    O
relatively    O
populous    O
centre    O
as    O
a    O
result    O
of    O
the    O
fast    O
pace    O
of    O
industrial    O
development    O
along    O
the    O
River    B-RiverBasin108518940
Clyde    I-RiverBasin108518940
and    O
improving    O
communications    O
.    O

This    O
in    O
turn    O
was    O
made    O
possible    O
by    O
the    O
steady    O
canalisation    O
of    O
the    O
River    B-RiverBasin108518940

between    O
1773    O
and    O
1830    O
's    O
,    O
which    O
deepened    O
and    O
narrowed    O
the    O
river    O

make    O
it    O
navigable    O

The    O

a    O

At    O
the    O

His    O
area    O

proximity    O
to    O
the    O

When    O

ran    O
for    O

The    O
idea    O
of    O
an    O
east    O
to    O
west    O
waterway    O
link    O
across    O
southern    O
England    O
was    O
first    O
mentioned    O
in    O
Elizabethan    O
times    O
,    O
between    O
1558    O
and    O
1603    O
,    O
to    O
take    O
advantage    O
of    O
the    O
proximity    O
of    O
the    O
rivers    O
Avon    O
and    O
Thames    B-RiverBasin108518940
,    O
only    O
apart    O

The    O
Royalists    O
reoccupied    O
Banbury    O

,    O
and    O
by    O
28    O
October    O
Charles    O
was    O
marching    O
down    O
the    O
Thames    B-RiverBasin108518940
valley    O
on    O
London    O
.    O

The    O
condition    O
of    O
this    O
threefold    O
advance    O
was    O
of    O
course    O
that    O
the    O
enemy    O
should    O
not    O
be    O
able    O
to    O
defeat    O
the    O
armies    O
in    O
detail    O
,    O
i.e.    O
,    O
that    O
he    O
should    O
be    O
fixed    O
and    O
held    O
in    O
the    O
Thames    B-RiverBasin108518940
valley    O
;    O
this    O
secured    O
,    O
there    O
was    O
no    O
purely    O
military    O
objection    O
against    O
operating    O
in    O
separate    O
armies    O
from    O
the    O
circumference    O
towards    O
the    O
centre    O
.    O

Another    O
sign    O
was    O

The    O

Echeverría    O
's    O
candidacy    O
rode    O
a    O
wave    O
of    O
anger    O
by    O
citizens    O
in    O
Northwestern    O
Mexico    O
against    O
the    O
United    O
States    O
for    O
its    O
use    O
(    O
and    O
perceived    O
misappropriation    O
)    O
of    O
water    O
from    O
the    O
Colorado    B-RiverBasin108518940
River    I-RiverBasin108518940
,    O
which    O
drains    O
much    O
of    O
the    O
American    O
Southwest    O
before    O
crossing    O
into    O
Mexico    O
.    O

Its    O
outlet    O
may    O
have    O
ultimately    O
emptied    O
into    O
the    O
Colorado    B-RiverBasin108518940

lake    O
was    O
fed    O

and    O
overflowed    O
into    O
the    O
Lake    O
Mojave    O
basin    O

from    O
there    O
to    O
Lake    O
Manly    O
in    O

less    O
likely    O
into    O

theory    O
assumes    O
that    O
the    O
Troy    O
Lake    O
basin    O
of    O

Manix    O
might    O
have    O

there    O
into    O
the    O
Colorado    B-RiverBasin108518940
River    I-RiverBasin108518940

this    O
theory    O
is    O
viewed    O
as    O
highly    O
questionable    O
,    O
although    O
paleocurrent    O
data    O
obtained    O
from    O

Russian    O
Turkologists    O
like    O
Nikita    O

in    O
the    O
19th    O

to    O
replace    O
the    O

Chinese    O

,    O
which    O
referred    O
to    O

In    O
China    O
,    O
the    O
term    O
Western    O
Regions    O
(;    O
Uyghur    O
:    O

referred    O

Several    O
influential    O
Russians    O
would    O
propose    O
new    O
terms    O
for    O
the    O

,    O
as    O
in    O
1805    O
when    O
the    O
Russian    O

Timovski    O
revived    O
the    O
use    O
of    O

Turkestan    O
"    O
to    O
refer    O
to    O

in    O
1829    O
,    O
when    O
the    O
Russian    O
sinologist    O
Nikita    O
Bichurin    O
proposed    O
the    O
use    O
of    O
"    O
East    O

replace    O

The    O

in    O
1819    O

when    O
Spain    O
ceded    O
Spanish    O
Florida    O
to    O
the    O
United    O
States    O
in    O
return    O

the    O

claimed    O

the    O
Red    O
River    O
formed    O
the    O
boundary    O
between    O
the    O

France    O
insisted    O
that    O

claimed    O
the    O

to    O
be    O

Spain    O
claimed    O

In    O
1793    O
,    O
the    O
King    O
of    O

decided    O
that    O
there    O

to    O
move    O
the    O

The    O
official    O

in    O
1841    O
as    O
the    O

The    O
flood    O

in    O
southern    O
France    O
,    O
he    O
picked    O
up    O
his    O
head    O

threw    O
it    O

back    O
to    O
England    O
by    O
returning    O
Crusaders    O
,    O
and    O
probably    O
trace    O
their    O
ancestry    O

According    O
to    O
Strabo    O
,    O
prior    O

used    O

currently    O
they    O

However    O
,    O
it    O
also    O
appears    O
that    O
Gnosticism    O
was    O
present    O
near    O
Lyon    O
:    O
he    O
writes    O
that    O
there    O
were    O
followers    O
of    O

The    O
Celts    O
inhabited    O
large    O
areas    O
of    O
Europe    O
from    O
the    O
Danube    O
to    O
the    O
Rhine    O
and    O

the    O
6th    O

a    O
period    O
sometimes    O
referred    O
to    O
as    O

a    O
site    O
in    O

Celtic    O
remains    O
were    O
discovered    O
in    O
1857    O

the    O
largest    O
of    O
the    O
Treveri    O
settlements    O
at    O
the    O
time    O
,    O
no    O
doubt    O
as    O
a    O
result    O
of    O
its    O
proximity    O
to    O
two    O
of    O
the    O
most    O
important    O
Celtic    O

For    O
centuries    O
,    O
possibly    O
thousands    O
of    O
years    O
,    O
these    O

The    O
area    O
of    O

chosen    O
for    O
the    O

one    O

Flooding    O
of    O
the    O

"    O
(    O
"    O

after    O

its    O
length    O
,    O
and    O
via    O
the    O

returned    O
to    O

came    O

The    O
legend    O
of    O
Pyanda    O
and    O
his    O
journey    O
on    O
the    O
Lena    O
and    O
Angara    O
was    O
recorded    O
by    O
naturalist    O
Johann    O
Georg    O
Gmelin    O
(    O
another    O
German    O
in    O
the    O
Russian    O
service    O
)    O
,    O
while    O
he    O
was    O
travelling    O
in    O
the    O
regions    O
of    O
the    O
Yenisey    B-RiverBasin108518940
and    O
Lena    B-RiverBasin108518940
.    O

Taking    O
about    O
40    O
men    O
with    O
him    O
,    O
he    O
went    O
to    O
Turukhansk    O
on    O
the    O
Yenisey    B-RiverBasin108518940
near    O
the    O
mouth    O
of    O
the    O
Lower    O
Tunguska    O
(    O
or    O
Nizhnyaya    O
Tunguska    O
in    O
Russian    O
)    O

This    O
may    O
have    O
referred    O

River    I-RiverBasin108518940
,    O
not    O
the    O
Lena    O
,    O
but    O
the    O
Russians    O
were    O
still    O
unaware    O
that    O
there    O
were    O
two    O
different    O
major    O
rivers    O
east    O
of    O
Yenisey    B-RiverBasin108518940
.    O

Pyanda    O
returned    O
to    O
"    O
Chechuysky    O
volok    O
"    O
and    O
decided    O
to    O
explore    O
another    O
way    O
back    O
to    O
Yenisey    B-RiverBasin108518940
.    O

Pyanda    O
and    O
his    O
men    O
successfully    O
passed    O
the    O
Angara    O
rapids    O
and    O
finally    O
reached    O
the    O
mouth    O
of    O
the    O
river    O
at    O
Yenisey    B-RiverBasin108518940
,    O
having    O
discovered    O
that    O
the    O
Angara    O
is    O
the    O
same    O
river    O
as    O
the    O
Upper    O
Tunguska    O
(    O
Verkhnyaya    O
Tunguska    O
)    O
,    O
as    O
it    O
was    O
previously    O
named    O
by    O
Yeniseyan    O
Cossacks    O
.    O

Pyanda    O
's    O
route    O
was    O
from    O
Turukhansk    O
upstream    O
the    O
N.    O
Tunguska    O
to    O
the    O
Lena    B-RiverBasin108518940
River    I-RiverBasin108518940
,    O
then    O
downstream    O
Lena    O
to    O
the    O
location    O
of    O
future    O
Yakutsk    O
,    O
then    O
back    O
upstream    O
and    O
via    O
the    O
Angara    O
River    O
back    O
to    O
the    O
Yenisei    B-RiverBasin108518940
.    O

watershed    O
.    O

Beginning    O
his    O
voyages    O
in    O
1874    O
,    O
he    O
twice    O
reached    O
the    O
Ob    B-RiverBasin108518940
River    I-RiverBasin108518940
,    O
and    O
five    O
times    O
carried    O
cargoes    O
to    O
the    O
Yenisei    B-RiverBasin108518940
River    I-RiverBasin108518940
,    O
up    O
which    O
stream    O
he    O
once    O
navigated    O
his    O
ship    O
2000    O
miles    O
(    O
3218    O
km    O
)    O

From    O
here    O
a    O

ran    O
west    O

about    O
where    O
to    O
locate    O
the    O

revolved    O
around    O
two    O

:    O
one    O
site    O
on    O
the    O
Potomac    O

They    O
planned    O

in    O

some    O
two    O

relations    O
,    O
though    O
the    O

was    O
later    O

to    O
the    O

number    O
between    O
two    O
and    O
three    O
hundred    O
by    O
the    O
time    O
he    O
began    O
his    O
campaign    O
in    O
May.    O
One    O
of    O
his    O
objectives    O
was    O
to    O

According    O
to    O

historical    O
documents    O
and    O
later    O
reconstructions    O
based    O
on    O
them    O
,    O
Pyanda    O
,    O
in    O
1620    O
-    O
1623    O
,    O
while    O
leading    O
a    O
party    O
which    O
was    O
hunting    O
for    O
Siberian    O
furs    O
and    O
buying    O
them    O
from    O
the    O

became    O

first    O
known    O

to    O
ascend    O
the    O
Lower    O
Tunguska    O

reach    O

,    O
one    O
of    O
the    O
world    O
's    O
greatest    O
rivers    O

According    O
to    O
later    O
legendary    O
accounts    O
,    O
collected    O
a    O
century    O
after    O
his    O
journey    O
,    O
Pyanda    O
allegedly    O
discovered    O
the    O
Lena    B-RiverBasin108518940
River    I-RiverBasin108518940
,    O
explored    O
much    O
of    O
its    O
length    O
,    O
and    O
via    O
the    O
Angara    O
River    O
returned    O
to    O
the    O
Yenisey    B-RiverBasin108518940
,    O
whence    O
he    O
came    O
.    O

Thus    O
,    O
in    O
three    O
and    O
a    O
half    O
years    O
from    O
1620    O
-    O
24    O
Pyanda    O
explored    O
some    O
1,430    O
miles    O
(    O
2,300    O
km    O
)    O
of    O
the    O
Lower    O

's    O
length    O
,    O
and    O
possibly    O
some    O
1,500    O
miles    O
(    O
2,400    O
km    O
)    O
of    O
the    O

and    O
some    O
870    O
miles    O
(    O
1400    O

)    O
of    O
the    O

The    O
legend    O
of    O
Pyanda    O
and    O
his    O
journey    O
on    O
the    O
Lena    O
and    O
Angara    O
was    O
recorded    O
by    O
naturalist    O
Johann    O
Georg    O
Gmelin    O
(    O
another    O
German    O
in    O
the    O
Russian    O
service    O
)    O
,    O
while    O
he    O
was    O
travelling    O
in    O
the    O
regions    O
of    O
the    O
Yenisey    B-RiverBasin108518940
and    O
Lena    B-RiverBasin108518940
.    O

Finally    O
,    O
in    O
1623    O
,    O
Pyanda    O
either    O
carried    O
his    O
strugs    O
to    O
the    O
Lena    B-RiverBasin108518940
or    O
built    O
new    O
boats    O
where    O
he    O
was    O
,    O
soon    O
reaching    O
this    O
great    O
river    O
of    O
Eastern    O
Siberia    O
.    O

Pyanda    O
's    O
route    O
was    O
from    O
Turukhansk    O
upstream    O
the    O
N.    O
Tunguska    O
to    O
the    O
Lena    B-RiverBasin108518940
River    I-RiverBasin108518940
,    O
then    O
downstream    O
Lena    O
to    O
the    O
location    O
of    O
future    O
Yakutsk    O
,    O
then    O
back    O
upstream    O
and    O
via    O
the    O
Angara    O
River    O
back    O
to    O
