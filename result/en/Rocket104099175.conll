According    O
to    O

,    O
the    O
engine    O

can    O
be    O
called    O
an    O

which    O
works    O

a    O

Other    O
likely    O

have    O
been    O

In    O
1962    O
they    O
were    O
also    O
selected    O
to    O
design    O
a    O

the    O

but    O
work    O
on    O
their    O
resulting    O
M-1    B-Rocket104099175
design    O
was    O
ended    O
in    O
1965    O
when    O
it    O
became    O
clear    O
the    O
public    O
's    O
support    O
for    O
a    O
massive    O

was    O
waning    O
.    O

Gimbaled    B-Rocket104099175
thrust    I-Rocket104099175
can    O
not    O
be    O
used    O
in    O
small    O
engines    O
due    O
to    O
the    O
complexity    O
of    O
gimbaling    O
mechanisms    O
,    O
thrust    O
vectoring    O
must    O
instead    O
be    O
achieved    O
by    O
thrusting    O
asymmetrically    O
in    O
multiple    O

The    O

was    O
designed    O
to    O
have    O
four    O

the    O
first    O
of    O
which    O

–    O
would    O
be    O

The    O

of    O
using    O

verniers    O
to    O
supply    O
vector    B-Rocket104099175

,    O
the    O
combustion    O
gases    O
are    O
distributed    O
by    O
an    O
electrically    O
driven    O
system    O
that    O
can    O
control    O
the    O
thrust    O
among    O
the    O
nozzles    O
.    O

Some    O
of    O
these    O
may    O
not    O
use    O
the    O
LAS    O
itself    O
,    O
but    O
would    O
use    O
the    O
second    O

Since    O
their    O
formation    O
in    O
1934    O
,    O
they    O
had    O
also    O
performed    O
experiments    O
involving    O

It    O
is    O
also    O
used    O
on    O
the    O
Soyuz    O
third    O

in    O
all    O
models    O
until    O
the    O
RD-0124    B-Rocket104099175
debut    O
on    O
the    O
2.1b    O

The    O
second    O

expected    O
to    O
sport    O

in    O

on    O
the    O
Soyuz-2    O
rocket    O
.    O

Kestrel    O
was    O
built    O
around    O
the    O

as    O
the    O
SpaceX    O

Ashes    O
were    O
feared    O
likely    O
to    O
block    O

Some    O
rockets    O
use    O
gas    O
from    O
a    O
gas    O
generator    O
to    O
pressurize    O
the    O
fuel    O
tank    O
;    O
usually    O
,    O
this    O
is    O
exhaust    O
from    O
a    O
turbopump    B-Rocket104099175

The    O
two    O

With    O
some    O
preliminary    O
investigation    O
completed    O

cited    O
the    O
cause    O
of    O
the    O

failure    O
as    O
likely    O
being    O

oxygen    O
tanks    O
for    O
the    O
first    O
two    O
X-1    O

were    O
pressurized    O
with    O
nitrogen    O

but    O
the    O
rest    O
used    O
gas    O

driven    O
turbopump    B-Rocket104099175
.    O

The    O
module    O
were    O

were    O
designed    O
to    O

at    O
up    O
to    O
120%    O
of    O
their    O
nominal    O
power    O
,    O
allowing    O
orbital    O
insertion    O
even    O
if    O
one    O
pump    O
failed    O
immediately    O
after    O
takeoff    O

Gas    O
turbines    O
are    O

used    O
in    O
many    O
liquid    O

turbines    O
are    O
used    O
to    O
power    O
a    O

to    O
permit    O
the    O
use    O
of    O
lightweight    O

,    O
which    O
reduce    O
the    O
empty    O

of    O
the    O
rocket    O
.    O

With    O
concentration    O
of    O
82%    O
,    O
it    O
is    O
still    O
in    O
