with    O

,    O
who    O
declared    O

his    O
preceptor    O
Cameron    O
;    O
but    O
,    O
like    O
Richard    B-Roundhead110540656
Baxter    I-Roundhead110540656
in    O
England    O
,    O
by    O
his    O
breadth    O
and    O
charity    O
he    O
exposed    O
himself    O
to    O
all    O

of    O
misconstruction    O
.    O

Richard    B-Roundhead110540656

's    O
advice    O
went    O
to    O
Oxford    O
,    O
where    O
he    O
was    O
much    O
influenced    O
by    O
William    O
Chillingworth    O
.    O

His    O
general    O
area    O
of    O

century    O

,    O
with    O
a    O

Philip    O

showing    O
how    O
the    O
neglect    O

act    O
.    O

Richard    B-Roundhead110540656

He    O
acted    O
as    O
a    O
peacemaker    O
amongst    O
the    O
Scottish    O
Presbyterians    O
,    O
fiercely    O
opposed    O
Catholicism    O
and    O
helped    O
to    O
maintain    O
the    O
Presbyterians    O
'    O
union    O
with    O
the    O
other    O

His    O
adoption    O
of    O
Congregational    O
principles    O
did    O
not    O
affect    O
his    O
theological    O
position    O
,    O
and    O
in    O
1647    O
he    O
again    O
argued    O
against    O
Arminianism    O
in    O
"    O

of    O

in    O
the    O

of    O
Christ    O
"    O
,    O
which    O
drew    O
him    O
into    O
long    O
debate    O
with    O
Richard    B-Roundhead110540656
Baxter    I-Roundhead110540656
.    O

Baxter    B-Roundhead110540656
and    O
Howe    O
also    O
answered    O
Stillingfleet    O
,    O
who    O
replied    O
in    O
"    O
The    O
Unreasonableness    O
of    O
Separation    O
"    O
.    O

Richard    B-Roundhead110540656
Baxter    I-Roundhead110540656
reported    O
that    O

,    O
Lazarus    O
,    O
Richard    O

and    O
John    O
Arrowsmith    O
were    O
not    O
hostile    O
to    O

redemption    O
.    O

This    O
was    O
a    O
reply    O

.    O

Richard    B-Roundhead110540656
Baxter    I-Roundhead110540656
held    O
to    O
a    O
form    O
of    O
Amyraldism    O
,    O
although    O
he    O
was    O
less    O
Calvinistic    O
than    O
Amyraut    O
.    O

With    O
Richard    B-Roundhead110540656
Baxter    I-Roundhead110540656
he    O
opened    O
a    O
correspondence    O
in    O
1654    O
,    O
complaining    O
to    O
him    O
about    O
separatists    O
.    O

Richard    B-Roundhead110540656
Baxter    I-Roundhead110540656
,    O
who    O
theorised    O
that    O
the    O
Independents    O
were    O
a    O
Catholic    O
conspiracy    O
,    O
found    O
in    O
Everard    O
a    O
possible    O
example    O
of    O
his    O
theory    O
,    O
that    O
Independents    O
might    O
be    O
crypto    O
-    O
Catholics    O

April    O
1645    O
a    O
force    O
under    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
retook    O
the    O
village    O
and    O
routed    O
the    O
Earl    O
of    O
Northampton    O
's    O
men    O
in    O
an    O
engagement    O
on    O
Islip    O
Bridge    O
.    O

It    O
influenced    O
the    O
political    O
thought    O
of    O
Presbyterian    O
politician    O
and    O
poet    O
John    O
Milton    O
,    O
assistant    O
to    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656

,    O
and    O

the    O
Royalist    O
left    O
,    O
and    O
charged    O
with    O
great    O
success    O
,    O
but    O
,    O
allowing    O
his    O
troopers    O
to    O
disperse    O
in    O
search    O
of    O
plunder    O
,    O
was    O
routed    O
by    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
at    O
the    O
close    O
of    O
the    O
battle    O
.    O

It    O
was    O
lost    O
during    O
the    O
English    O
Civil    O
War    O
when    O
Cromwell's    B-Roundhead110540656
troops    O
destroyed    O
the    O
hall    O
leaving    O
only    O
the    O
fortified    O
tower    O
standing    O
.    O

His    O
talent    O
ensured    O
that    O
his    O
career    O
was    O
not    O
interrupted    O
by    O
Charles    O
's    O
execution    O
,    O
and    O
he    O
served    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
,    O
whom    O
he    O
painted    O

,    O
and    O
Richard    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
.    O

He    O
declined    O
to    O
serve    O
,    O
on    O
the    O
ground    O
that    O
levying    O
war    O
against    O
the    O
Lord    O
Protector    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
was    O
not    O
within    O
the    O
statute    O
of    O
treason    O
;    O
and    O
in    O
consequence    O
was    O
removed    O
from    O
his    O
place    O
(    O
3    O
May    O
)    O
,    O
and    O
resumed    O
practice    O
at    O
the    O
bar    O
.    O

He    O
is    O
credited    O
to    O
have    O
advised    O
Charles    O
I    O
of    O
England    O
,    O

of    O

for    O
advice    O
by    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656

supported    O

few    O
now    O
expected    O
to    O
beat    O
the    O
English    O
;    O
the    O
Orangist    O
faction    O
lost    O
political    O
influence    O

Grand    O
Pensionary    O
Johan    O
de    O

was    O
willing    O
to    O
give    O
formal    O
treaty    O
assurances    O
to    O
Cromwell    B-Roundhead110540656
that    O
the    O

III    O
of    O
Orange    O
would    O
never    O
become    O

not    O
deprive    O

It    O
is    O
believed    O
that    O
the    O
destruction    O

The    O
mid-17th    O
century    O
was    O
a    O
period    O
of    O
constant    O
religious    O
and    O
political    O
turmoil    O
in    O
England    O
and    O
in    O
Europe    O
which    O
culminated    O
in    O
the    O
English    O
Civil    O
War    O
,    O
a    O
series    O
of    O
conflicts    O
,    O
the    O
first    O
of    O
which    O
was    O
fought    O
between    O
King    O
Charles    O
I    O
and    O
Parliament    O
,    O
and    O
led    O
ultimately    O
to    O
the    O
Protectorship    O
of    O
the    O
Puritan    O
general    O
,    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
.    O

Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
was    O
responsible    O
for    O
its    O
destruction    O
in    O
the    O
English    O
Civil    O
War    O
(    O
1642–51    O
)    O
.    O

In    O
the    O
morning    O
,    O
they    O
sought    O
shelter    O
at    O
Madeley    O
from    O
Francis    O
Wolfe    O
,    O
another    O
Catholic    O
of    O
Penderel    O
's    O
acquaintance    O
,    O
but    O
finding    O
the    O
crossings    O
of    O
the    O
River    O
Severn    O
were    O
guarded    O
by    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
's    O
soldiers    O
,    O

returned    O
to    O
Hobbal    O
Grange    O
on    O
Saturday    O
5    O
September    O
.    O

The    O
explanation    O
is    O
simple    O
,    O
for    O
in    O
1652    O
the    O
ship    O
"    O
John    O
and    O
Sara    O
"    O

in    O
Boston    O
bringing    O
two    O
hundred    O
and    O
seventy    O
-    O
two    O
Scotsmen    O
,    O
who    O
had    O
been    O
taken    O
prisoners    O
by    O
Cromwell    B-Roundhead110540656
.    O

The    O
hoard    O
was    O
probably    O
hidden    O
at    O
the    O
time    O
that    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
came    O
to    O
Pembrokeshire    O

Cottage    O

(    O

,    O
which    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
is    O
said    O
to    O
have    O
visited    O
.    O

There    O
was    O
also    O
a    O
chapel    O
belonging    O
to    O
Cruwys    O
Morchard    O
House    O
which    O
was    O
the    O
burial    O
place    O
of    O
the    O
Cruwys    O
family    O
but    O
the    O
chapel    O
was    O
destroyed    O
by    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
and    O
it    O
is    O
believed    O
that    O
many    O
family    O
monuments    O
were    O
destroyed    O
at    O
the    O
same    O
time    O
.    O

Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
appointed    O
him    O
court    O
organist    O
and    O
keeper    O
of    O
instruments    O
.    O

They    O
had    O
fourteen    O
children    O
,    O
one    O
of    O
whom    O
was    O
John    B-Roundhead110540656
(    O
1625–1688    O
)    O
who    O
married    O
a    O
daughter    O
of    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
.    O

Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
was    O
sympathetic    O
to    O
the    O
Jewish    O
cause    O
,    O
partly    O
because    O
of    O
his    O
tolerant    O
leanings    O
but    O
chiefly    O
because    O
he    O
foresaw    O
the    O
importance    O
for    O
English    O
commerce    O
of    O
the    O
participation    O
of    O
the    O
Jewish    O
merchant    O
princes    O
,    O
some    O
of    O
whom    O
had    O
already    O
made    O
their    O
way    O
to    O
London    O
.    O

The    O
edict    O
was    O
overturned    O
during    O
the    O
Protectorate    O
more    O
than    O
three    O
centuries    O
later    O
,    O
when    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
permitted    O
Jews    O
to    O
return    O
to    O
England    O
in    O
1657    O
.    O

Their    O
position    O
enabled    O
them    O
to    O
give    O
Cromwell    B-Roundhead110540656

that    O
led    O
to    O
the    O
Navigation    O
Act    O

made    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656

want    O
to    O
attract    O
the    O
rich    O
Jews    O
of    O

so    O
that    O

with    O

from    O

When    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656
invaded    O
Scotland    O
in    O
1650    O
,    O
he    O
disregarded    O
Urquhart    O
in    O

of    O
building    O
forts    O
at    O
either    O
end    O

was    O
strategically    O
important    O
during    O
the    O

Civil    O
War    O
,    O
and    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656

went    O
there    O
to    O
take    O
it    O

The    O
bridge    O
was    O
a    O
strategic    O
position    O
in    O
the    O
English    O

as    O
in    O
1646    O
Oliver    B-Roundhead110540656
Cromwell    I-Roundhead110540656

with    O
500    O
Dragoons    O
and    O
1,000    O
horsemen    O
to    O
take    O
the    O
bridge    O
.    O

He    O
was    O
a    O
staunch    O
monarchist    O
,    O
possibly    O
due    O
to    O
his    O
father    O

generous    O
treatment    O
by    O
