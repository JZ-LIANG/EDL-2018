In    O
his    O

he    O
assails    O
in    O
acrid    O
terms    O
the    O

prevailing    O
in    O

In    O
1569    O
,    O
the    O
Venetian    O
ambassador    O
had    O
identified    O
her    O
with    O
her    O

:    O

recognises    O

spirit    O
of    O

It    O
is    O
believed    O
that    O
Niccolò    O
Machiavelli    O
,    O
during    O
his    O
1513    O
imprisonment    O
after    O
allegedly    O
conspiring    O
against    O
the    O

this    O

of    O

The    O
first    O
madrigals    O
were    O
written    O
in    O
Florence    O
,    O
either    O
by    O
native    O
Florentines    O
or    O
by    O
Franco    O

in    O

charge    O
.    O

However    O
,    O
around    O
1675    O
,    O
he    O
seems    O
to    O
have    O
rejected    O
this    O
plan    O
,    O
travelling    O
to    O
Florence    O
,    O
where    O
he    O
became    O
a    O

In    O
1513    O
Ippolito    O
moved    O
again    O
to    O

,    O
when    O
in    O

the    O

,    O
the    O

returned    O
again    O
to    O

The    O
university    O
's    O
role    O
as    O
a    O
state    O
institution    O
became    O
more    O
accentuated    O
during    O

period    O
.    O

initiated    O
by    O

)    O
,    O
and    O
enriched    O
the    O
university    O
library    O
with    O
important    O
publications    O
.    O

Charles    O
VIII    O
moved    O
it    O
back    O
from    O
1497–1515    O
,    O
but    O
it    O
was    O
moved    O
to    O
Pisa    O
again    O
when    O
the    O
Medici    B-Royalty108153437
family    O
returned    O
to    O
power    O
.    O

The    O
city    O
authorities    O
,    O
however    O
,    O
successfully    O
asked    O
the    O
Medici    B-Royalty108153437
(    O
the    O
hereditary    O
dukes    O
of    O
Florence    O
at    O

time    O
)    O
to    O
preserve    O
the    O
academy    O
.    O

This    O
time    O
the    O
penalty    O
was    O
a    O
hefty    O

fine    O
,    O
and    O
four    O
years    O
of    O
prison    O
,    O
remitted    O
to    O
four    O
years    O
of    O
house    O
arrest    O
thanks    O
to    O
the    O
intercession    O
of    O
the    O
Medici    B-Royalty108153437
.    O

Although    O
originally    O
intended    O
to    O
be    O
placed    O
over    O
his    O
tomb    O
,    O
this    O
crucifix    O
was    O
sold    O
to    O
the    O
Medici    B-Royalty108153437
family    O
who    O
gave    O
it    O
to    O
Spain    O
.    O

He    O
subsequently    O
began    O
to    O
work    O
in    O
the    O
Medici    B-Royalty108153437
court    O
,    O
first    O
as    O
a    O
tenor    O
singer    O
and    O
keyboard    O
player    O
,    O
and    O
later    O
as    O
a    O
composer    O
.    O

Born    O
in    O
Florence    O
,    O
he    O
was    O
the    O
son    O
of    O
a    O

Andrea    O
Carnesecchi    O
,    O

under    O
the    O
patronage    O
of    O
the    O
Medici    B-Royalty108153437
,    O
and    O
especially    O
of    O
Giulio    O
de    O
'    O
Medici    O
as    O
Pope    O
Clement    O
VII    O
,    O
rapidly    O
rose    O
to    O
high    O
office    O
at    O
the    O
papal    O
court    O
.    O

This    O
was    O
done    O
with    O
the    O
permission    O
of    O
the    O
Medici    B-Royalty108153437
pope    O
Clement    O
VII    O
,    O
but    O
"    O
long    O
before    O
then    O
,    O
in    O
fact    O
since    O
the    O

appearance    O
of    O

,    O
controversy    O
had    O
swirled    O
about    O
his    O
writings    O
"    O
.    O

He    O
then    O
explicitly    O
proposes    O
that    O
the    O

are    O
now    O

His    O
political    O
thought    O
and    O
actions    O
seem    O
to    O
offer    O
numerous    O
contradictions    O
:    O
he    O
wanted    O
to    O
be    O
the    O
friend    O
both    O
of    O
legitimist    O
royalty    O
and    O
of    O
freedom    O
,    O
alternately    O
defending    O
which    O
of    O
the    O
two    O
seemed    O
more    O
in    O
danger    O
:    O
"    O
I    O

the    O

in    O
fact    O
it    O

more    O

that    O
the    O

is    O

was    O
to    O

A    O
certain    O

achieved    O
under    O
the    O

Dynasty    I-Royalty108153437
,    O
at    O

period    O
(    O
1081–1185    O
)    O
that    O
the    O
cult    O
of    O
the    O
icon    O
became    O
widespread    O
in    O
the    O
Byzantine    O
world    O
,    O
partly    O
on    O
account    O
of    O
the    O
dearth    O

rose    O

great    O
prominence    O
in    O
the    O

of    O

continued    O
throughout    O

The    O

refers    O
to    O
the    O
period    O
from    O
the    O
late    O
15th    O
century    O

to    O

At    O
the    O
end    O
of    O
the    O
15th    O
century    O
,    O
the    O
Jagiellonians    B-Royalty108153437
reigned    O
over    O
vast    O

This    O

time    O
of    O
the    O
1572    O
death    O
of    O

of    O
the    O
Jagiellonian    B-Royalty108153437
dynasty    I-Royalty108153437
.    O

Based    O
on    O
traditions    O
dating    O
to    O
the    O
very    O
beginning    O
of    O
the    O
Polish    O
statehood    O

strengthened    O
during    O
the    O
Piast    O
and    O
Jagiellon    B-Royalty108153437
dynasties    O
,    O
they    O
reached    O
their    O
final    O
form    O
in    O
the    O
period    O
of    O
the    O
Polish    O
-    O
Lithuanian    O
Commonwealth    O
between    O
1572    O
and    O
1791    O

The    O
principle    O
of    O
election    O
continued    O
in    O
effect    O
throughout    O
the    O
nearly    O
two    O
centuries    O
of    O
the    O

,    O
but    O
just    O
as    O
in    O
Piast    O
times    O
,    O
it    O
actually    O
amounted    O
to    O
mere    O
confirmation    O
of    O
the    O
incoming    O
heir    O

the    O

The    O
union    O
was    O
transformed    O
into    O
a    O
closer    O
one    O
by    O
the    O
Union    O
of    O

The    O
underlying    O
concept    O
was    O
to    O
define    O

as    O

to    O
the    O
medieval    O

which    O
was    O
simplified    O
into    O
a    O
picture    O
of    O
an    O
ethnically    O

that    O
matched    O

,    O
which    O
was    O

this    O
protectorate    O
(    O

)    O
quickly    O
became    O

that    O
reason    O
Vicenza    O

origin    O

Francesco    O
I    O
(    O
1382–1407    O

abandoned    O
the    O

alliance    O
with    O
the    O
Visconti    B-Royalty108153437
of    O
Milan    O
,    O
in    O
order    O
to    O
align    O
their    O
rising    O
power    O
with    O
the    O
Republic    O
of    O
Venice    O
.    O

Starting    O
from    O
1436    O
(    O
perhaps    O
without    O
the    O
approval    O
of    O

he    O
entered    O
the    O

the    O

Republican    O
Siena    O
had    O
a    O
large    O
influence    O
on    O
the    O
development    O
of    O
the    O
style    O
,    O
but    O
kept    O
to    O
its    O
own    O
dignified    O
Gothic    O
style    O
throughout    O
the    O
period    O
,    O
and    O
afterwards    O
,    O
while    O
the    O
flamboyant    O
Visconti    B-Royalty108153437
court    O
at    O
Milan    O
,    O
also    O
closely    O
related    O
to    O
the    O

royal    O
family    O

most    O
important    O

centre    O
of    O
the    O

Despite    O
his    O
influence    O
,    O
his    O
power    O
was    O
not    O
absolute    O
;    O
Florence    O
's    O
legislative    O
councils    O
at    O
times    O
resisted    O
his    O
proposals    O
,    O
something    O
which    O
would    O
not    O
have    O
been    O
tolerated    O
by    O
the    O
Visconti    B-Royalty108153437
of    O
Milan    O
,    O
for    O
instance    O
;    O
throughout    O
his    O
life    O
he    O
was    O
always    O
"    O
primus    O
inter    O
pares    O
"    O
(    O
"    O
first    O
among    O

His    O
family    O
was    O
a    O
noble    O
one    O

exiled    O
with    O
the    O

In    O
the    O

As    O

himself    O
to    O
attempt    O

over    O

In    O
Finland    O
,    O
local    O

in    O
the    O
7th    O
century    O
at    O
the    O
borders    O
of    O
Austrasia    O
and    O
rapidly    O
developed    O
at    O
the    O
end    O
of    O
the    O

By    O
the    O
7th    O
century    O
,    O
a    O
regular    O

then    O
,    O
after    O
a    O
period    O
of    O
viscounts    O
of    O
Marseille    O
,    O

came    O
under    O
local    O
papal    O

the    O
papal    O
bull    O
of    O
Urban    O
II    O
in    O
1088    O

This    O
mythology    O
flourished    O
among    O
the    O
Franks    O
until    O
the    O
conversion    O
of    O

there    O
were    O
many    O

before    O

Because    O
of    O
the    O
attack    O

it    O
was    O
unknown    O
if    O
Merovech    O
,    O

legendary    O
founder    O
of    O

For    O
four    O
centuries    O
,    O
from    O
the    O

to    O
the    O
Carolingian    O
the    O
waters    O
of    O

Namatius    O
(    O

was    O
the    O
rector    O
of    O

under    O
the    O
Merovingians    B-Royalty108153437

his    O

in    O
office    O
.    O

In    O
751    O
,    O
Pepin    O
and    O
Bertrada    O
became    O
King    O
and    O
Queen    O
of    O
the    O

,    O
following    O
Pepin    O
's    O
successful    O
coup    O
against    O
the    O
Frankish    O
Merovingian    B-Royalty108153437
monarchs    O
.    O

Later    O
the    O
Merovingian    B-Royalty108153437
and    O
Carolingian    O
dynasties    O
had    O
counts    O
palatine    O
,    O
as    O
did    O
the    O
Holy    O
Roman    O
Empire    O
.    O

But    O
its    O
spelling    O
slightly    O
changed    O
in    O
European    O
languages    O
:    O
Latin    O
"    O
palatinus    O
"    O
,    O
plural    O
"    O
palatini    O
"    O
was    O
still    O
an    O
office    O
in    O
Merovingian    B-Royalty108153437
times    O
,    O
today    O
referred    O
to    O
as    O
the    O
Count    O
Palatine    O
.    O

The    O
most    O
important    O
of    O
these    O
was    O
the    O
"    O
comes    O
palatinus    O
"    O
,    O
the    O
count    O
palatine    O
,    O
who    O
in    O
Merovingian    B-Royalty108153437
and    O
Carolingian    O
times    O
(    O
5th    O
through    O
10th    O
century    O
)    O
was    O
an    O
official    O
of    O
the    O
sovereign    O

in    O

of    O
his    O

the    O
imperial    O
palaces    O
(    O

The    O
palace    O
is    O
also    O
distinguishable    O
from    O
Merovingian    B-Royalty108153437

by    O
its    O

The    O

was    O
most    O
commonly    O
used    O
in    O
the    O
Merovingian    B-Royalty108153437

Its    O

its    O

deeply    O
unpopular    O
.    O

In    O
1713    O
he    O
was    O
promoted    O

Bishop    O
of    O
Rochester    O
and    O
Dean    O
of    O

and    O
if    O
the    O
Tories    O
had    O
remained    O
in    O
power    O
he    O
might    O
have    O
risen    O
much    O
higher    O
,    O
so    O
he    O
dreaded    O
the    O

The    O

was    O
briefly    O
poised    O
to    O

She    O
is    O
descended    O
in    O
three    O
lines    O
from    O
the    O

thus    O
in    O
the    O
extended    O
line    O
of    O
succession    O
to    O
the    O
British    O
throne    O
.    O

In    O
the    O
19th    O
century    O
the    O
castle    O
was    O
occasionally    O
used    O
by    O
the    O
Hanoverian    B-Royalty108153437
royal    I-Royalty108153437

The    O
street    O
is    O
one    O
of    O
a    O
number    O
that    O
were    O
named    O
after    O
female    O
queens    O
and    O
princesses    O
of    O
the    O

was    O
settled    O
.    O

This    O
process    O
is    O
perhaps    O
most    O
noticeable    O
in    O
the    O
evolution    O
of    O
a    O
