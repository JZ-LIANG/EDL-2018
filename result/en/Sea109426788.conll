the    O
early    O

the    O
most    O

for    O
European    O

The    O
eel    O
lives    O
in    O
fresh    O
water    O
and    O
estuaries    O
and    O
only    O
leaves    O

in    O
the    O

,    O
trade    O
networks    O
connecting    O

History    O
has    O
also    O
equally    O
provoked    O
the    O
destination    O
change    O
of    O
places    O
of    O
worship    O
,    O
and    O
notably    O
around    O
the    O
Mediterranean    B-Sea109426788
.    O

A    O
plausible    O
explanation    O
is    O
that    O
it    O
was    O
"    O
the    O
experience    O
of    O
travellers    O
that    O
suggested    O
such    O
an    O
explanation    O
for    O
the    O
variation    O
in    O
the    O
observable    O
altitude    O
and    O
the    O
change    O
in    O
the    O
area    O
of    O
circumpolar    O
stars    O
,    O
a    O
change    O
that    O
was    O
quite    O
drastic    O
between    O
Greek    O
settlements    O
"    O
around    O
the    O
eastern    O
Mediterranean    B-Sea109426788
Sea    I-Sea109426788
,    O
particularly    O
those    O
between    O
the    O
Nile    O
Delta    O
and    O
Crimea    O
.    O

This    O
argument    O
was    O
put    O
forward    O
by    O
the    O
geographer    O
Strabo    O
(    O
c.    O
64    O
BC    O
–    O
24    O
AD    O
)    O
,    O
who    O
suggested    O
that    O
the    O
spherical    O
shape    O
of    O
the    O
Earth    O
was    O
probably    O
known    O
to    O
seafarers    O
around    O
the    O
Mediterranean    B-Sea109426788
Sea    I-Sea109426788
since    O
at    O
least    O
the    O
time    O
of    O
Homer    O
,    O
citing    O
a    O
line    O
from    O
the    O
"    O
Odyssey    O
"    O
as    O
indicating    O
that    O
the    O
poet    O
Homer    O
knew    O
of    O
this    O
as    O
early    O
as    O
the    O
7th    O
or    O
8th    O
century    O
BC    O
.    O

During    O
that    O
period    O
the    O
Flemish    O
cartographer    O
,    O
Mercator    O
,    O
made    O
successive    O
reductions    O
in    O
the    O
size    O
of    O
the    O
Mediterranean    B-Sea109426788
Sea    I-Sea109426788
and    O
all    O
of    O
Europe    O
which    O
had    O
the    O
effect    O
of    O
increasing    O
the    O
size    O
of    O
the    O
earth    O
.    O

The    O

the    O

governor    O
of    O

considered    O
somewhat    O
more    O
precise    O

it    O

,    O
the    O
Ottoman    O
Empire    O
was    O
at    O
the    O
center    O
of    O
interactions    O
between    O
the    O
Eastern    O

Western    O
worlds    O
for    O
six    O

.    O

The    O
goal    O
of    O
the    O
organization    O
at    O
that    O
point    O
was    O
the    O

the    O
sake    O
of    O
the    O
future    O

state    O
and    O
preventing    O
the    O
Arab    O
Legion    O
from    O
driving    O
out    O
the    O
Jewish    O
community    O

Meanwhile    O
,    O
the    O
Turks    O
consolidated    O
control    O

closing    O

It    O
is    O
interesting    O
to    O
note    O
that    O
some    O

In    O
several    O

Christopher    O
Tolkien    O

that    O
this    O

was    O
later    O

.    O

Tolkien    O
originally    O
described    O
that    O

that    O
the    O

surface    O
of    O
the    O
Earth    O
up    O
to    O
the    O
Walls    O

divided    O

three    O

birds    O
could    O
keep    O
aloft    O
only    O

while    O
the    O
Eagles    O
of    O

could    O
fly    O
"    O
beyond    O
the    O

the    O

the    O

The    O

Although    O
mainly    O
operating    O
in    O

around    O
the    O
Channel    O
,    O
they    O
also    O
sailed    O
near    O
the    O
Danish    O

coastal    O
areas    O

In    O
late    O
October    O

Militarily    O
it    O

The    O
chief    O
argument    O

the    O

it    O

The    O
name    O
was    O

a    O

The    O
potential    O
