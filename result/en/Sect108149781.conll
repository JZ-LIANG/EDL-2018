According    O
to    O
Wilbur    O
(    O

)    O
it    O
was    O
his    O
strong    O
stance    O
against    O
the    O
worship    O
of    O

prayer    O
to    O
Christ    O
that    O

According    O
to    O
this    O

the    O
main    O

for    O
his    O
conviction    O
as    O
"    O
vehemently    O
suspected    O
of    O
heresy    O
"    O
was    O
not    O
his    O
advocacy    O
of    O
the    O
Copernican    O
worldview    O
,    O
but    O
his    O
earlier    O
conflict    O
with    O
the    O
Jesuit    B-Sect108149781
in    O
his    O
book    O
"    O
Il    O
Saggiatore    O
"    O
of    O
1623    O
,    O
in    O
which    O
he    O
advocated    O
an    O
atomist    O
theory    O
of    O
Democritus    O
that    O
ran    O
counter    O
to    O
Aristotelian    O
doctrines    O
endorsed    O
by    O
Rome    O
as    O
well    O
as    O

doctrine    O
of    O
the    O

Its    O

the    O
only    O
result    O
of    O
all    O

was    O
to    O

against    O

The    O

with    O
the    O
responsibility    O

the    O

the    O

and    O
elsewhere    O
as    O

According    O
to    O
at    O
least    O
one    O
journalist    O
(    O
John    O
R.    O
Bradley    O
)    O
,    O
the    O
ruling    O
Saudi    O
family    O
was    O
caught    O
between    O
depending    O
for    O
military    O
defense    O
on    O
the    O
United    O

,    O
while    O
also    O
depending    O
for    O
domestic    O
support    O
on    O
the    O

religious    O
establishment    O
,    O
which    O
as    O
a    O
matter    O
of    O
religious    O
doctrine    O
"    O
ultimately    O
seeks    O
the    O

including    O
that    O

—    O
the    O

But    O
doing    O
so    O
in    O
Saudi    O
meant    O
a    O
more    O
anti    O

itself    O

During    O
the    O
interval    O
of    O
generally    O
disagreeable    O
Shi'a    O
rule    O
,    O
the    O
Berber    O
people    O
appear    O
to    O
have    O
ideologically    O
moved    O
away    O
from    O
a    O
popular    O
antagonism    O
against    O
the    O
Islamic    O
east    O
(    O

,    O
and    O
toward    O
an    O
acquiescence    O
to    O
its    O
Sunni    O
orthodoxy    O
,    O
though    O
of    O
course    O
mediated    O
by    O
their    O
own    O
Maliki    B-Sect108149781
school    O
of    O
law    O

Yet    O
evidently    O
because    O
of    O
the    O
narrow    O
legalism    O
then    O
common    O
among    O
Maliki    B-Sect108149781
jurists    O
and    O
because    O
of    O
their    O
influence    O
in    O
the    O
rival    O
Almoravid    O
regime    O
,    O
Ibn    O

the    O

law    O
favoring    O
instead    O
the    O
Zahiri    B-Sect108149781
school    O
.    O

After    O
an    O
hiatus    O
under    O
the    O
Almohads    O
,    O
the    O

its    O
full    O
traditional    O
jurisdiction    O
over    O
the    O

Later    O
,    O
after    O
his    O

to    O

,    O
he    O

was    O
appointed    O

The    O
opinion    O
held    O
by    O
Imam    O
Malik    O
and    O
all    O
Maliki    B-Sect108149781

is    O
that    O

other    O

are    O

The    O
Hanbali    O

is    O
the    O

of    O

In    O
cases    O
where    O
there    O
is    O
no    O
clear    O
answer    O
in    O
sacred    O
texts    O
of    O
Islam    O
,    O
the    O
Hanbali    O
school    O
does    O
not    O
accept    O
jurist    O
discretion    O
or    O
customs    O
of    O
a    O
community    O
as    O
a    O
sound    O
basis    O
to    O
derive    O
Islamic    O
law    O
,    O
a    O
method    O
that    O
Hanafi    B-Sect108149781
and    O
Maliki    B-Sect108149781
Sunni    O
fiqhs    O
accept    O
.    O

Unlike    O
the    O
other    O
three    O
schools    O
of    O
Islamic    O
jurisprudence    O
(    O
Hanafi    B-Sect108149781
,    O
Maliki    B-Sect108149781
,    O
and    O
Shafi    O
)    O
,    O
the    O
Hanbali    O
madhab    O
remained    O
largely    O
traditionalist    O
or    O
Athari    O
in    O
theology    O
and    O
it    O
was    O
primarily    O
Hanbali    O
scholars    O
who    O
codified    O
the    O
Athari    O
school    O
of    O
thought    O
.    O

This    O
ruling    O
is    O
similar    O
to    O
the    O
Maliki    B-Sect108149781
opinion    O
,    O
however    O
the    O
Shafi'i    O
opinion    O
is    O
that    O
merely    O
touching    O
a    O
woman    O
will    O
break    O
the    O
wudu    O
,    O
while    O
the    O
Hanafi    O
opinion    O
is    O
that    O
merely    O
touching    O
a    O
woman    O
does    O
not    O
break    O
the    O
wudu    O
.    O

In    O
the    O
earlier    O
period    O
,    O
Sunni    O
jurisprudence    O
was    O
based    O
on    O
four    O
other    O
schools    O
:    O
Hanafi    B-Sect108149781
,    O
Maliki    B-Sect108149781
,    O
Shafi'i    O
and    O
Zahiri    B-Sect108149781
;    O
later    O
on    O
,    O
the    O
Hanbali    O
school    O
supplanted    O
the    O
Zahiri    O
school    O
's    O
spot    O
as    O
the    O
fourth    O
mainstream    O
school    O
.    O

In    O
comparison    O
to    O
the    O
Hanafi    B-Sect108149781
and    O
the    O
Maliki    B-Sect108149781
,    O
in    O
the    O
absence    O
of    O
a    O
consensus    O
,    O
the    O
opinion    O
of    O
a    O
Sahabi    O
is    O
given    O
priority    O
over    O
Qiyas    O
(    O
which    O
early    O
Hanbalis    O
rejected    O
)    O
or    O
al-'urf    O
,    O
which    O
is    O
completely    O
rejected    O
by    O
Hanbalis    O
.    O

In    O
Sunni    O
Maliki    B-Sect108149781
school    O
of    O
jurisprudence    O
(    O
fiqh    O

,    O
disease    O
,    O
life    O

grounds    O
for    O
the    O
wife    O

the    O
husband    O
to    O
seek    O
annulment    O
of    O

the    O
