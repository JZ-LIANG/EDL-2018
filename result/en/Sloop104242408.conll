It    O
is    O

Charles    O

named    O
by    O
his    O
friend    O
Joseph    O
Dalton    O
Hooker    O
,    O

described    O

'    O
(    O
becoming    O
a    O
shrub    O

as    O
he    O
thought    O
that    O
Darwin    O
had    O
made    O
a    O
mistake    O
in    O
calling    O
it    O
a    O
tree    O
,    O
