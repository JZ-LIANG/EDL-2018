some    O
resemblance    O
to    O
that    O
of    O
Denniston    B-Slope109437454
,    O
being    O
a    O
town    O
that    O
lived    O
from    O
and    O
for    O
the    O
coal    O
that    O
was    O
mined    O
in    O
the    O
Ranges    O
.    O

Despite    O
its    O
elevation    O
of    O
260    O
metres    O
being    O
considerably    O
lower    O
than    O

of    O
Denniston    B-Slope109437454
(    O
600    O
metres    O
)    O
,    O
the    O
steep    O
grade    O
between    O
the    O
coastline    O
and    O
Millerton    O
still    O
meant    O
that    O
the    O
coal    O
was    O
difficult    O
to    O
get    O
down    O
from    O
the    O
hilltop    O
to    O
the    O
coastal    O

at    O
