a    O

He    O
has    O
been    O
criticized    O
by    O
Kenneth    O
Arrow    O
for    O
a    O
somewhat    O
poor    O
reading    O
of    O
some    O
sociological    O
classics    O
(    O
though    O
he    O
never    O
claimed    O
to    O
be    O
a    O
sociologist    O
)    O
,    O
such    O
as    O
the    O
works    O
of    O
Émile    B-SocialAnthropologist110618465
Durkheim    I-SocialAnthropologist110618465
;    O
while    O
this    O
may    O
partly    O
reflect    O
his    O
somewhat    O
inadequate    O
academic    O
training    O
,    O
it    O
also    O
derives    O
from    O
his    O
impatience    O
with    O
non    O
-    O
participatory    O
sociology    O
and    O
his    O
preference    O
(    O
this    O
became    O
a    O
defining    O
characteristic    O
of    O
"    O
his    O
"    O
discipline    O
of    O
'    O

'    O
)    O
for    O
engagement    O
with    O
contemporary    O
social    O
policy    O
issues    O
and    O
even    O
some    O
of    O
its    O
more    O
fallible    O
institutions    O
.    O

Like    O
early    O
sociologist    O
Émile    B-SocialAnthropologist110618465
Durkheim    I-SocialAnthropologist110618465
,    O
they    O
viewed    O
natural    O
economies    O
as    O
characterized    O
by    O
mechanical    O
solidarity    O
(    O
like    O
so    O
many    O
peas    O
in    O
a    O
pod    O
)    O
whereas    O
the    O
civilized    O
division    O
of    O
labour    O
made    O
producers    O
mutually    O
dependent    O
upon    O
one    O
another    O
resulting    O
in    O
organic    O
solidarity    O
.    O

He    O
suggests    O
that    O
it    O
is    O
impossible    O
to    O
give    O
a    O
satisfactory    O
universal    O
definition    O
of    O
religion    O
,    O
and    O
that    O
early    O
opponents    O
of    O
religion    O
such    O
as    O
Edward    O
Taylor    O
,    O

and    O
Émile    B-SocialAnthropologist110618465
Durkheim    I-SocialAnthropologist110618465
were    O
indulging    O
in    O
"    O
scholarly    O
fantazising    O
"    O
about    O
forms    O
of    O
primitive    O
religion    O

were    O
refuted    O
