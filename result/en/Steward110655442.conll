It    O
is    O
not    O
surprising    O
that    O
John    O
Cowper    O

should    O
,    O
after    O
he    O
moved    O

decide    O
to    O
begin    O
a    O
novel    O
about    O
Owen    O
Glendower    O
,    O
because    O
it    O
was    O
in    O
Corwen    O
that    O
Owen    O
's    O
rebellion    O
against    O

on    O

,    O
when    O
he    O
formally    O
assumed    O
the    O
ancestral    O
title    O
of    O
Prince    O
of    O
Powys    O
at    O
his    O
manor    O

of    O

His    O

,    O
Robert    O

had    O

He    O

Minister    O
Neville    O
Chamberlain    O
to    O

Wolseley    O

Singer    O
proved    O
to    O
be    O

He    O
also    O

His    O
most    O
enduring    O
case    O
was    O
Bushel    O
's    O
Case    O
in    O
1670    O
,    O
which    O
set    O
the    O
precedent    O
that    O
a    O
jury    O
could    O
not    O
be    O
forced    O
into    O
changing    O
a    O
verdict    O
which    O
a    O
judge    O
does    O
not    O
approve    O
of    O
,    O
one    O
that    O
has    O
endured    O
ever    O

The    O
title    O
"    O
Cabal    O
"    O
resulted    O
from    O
the    O
perception    O
that    O

together    O
in    O

in    O
its    O
increasingly    O
secretive    O
conduct    O
of    O
government    O
,    O
and    O
was    O
helped    O
by    O
the    O
fact    O
that    O
the    O
initial    O
letters    O

his    O

required    O
their    O
presence    O
,    O
though    O
perhaps    O
also    O
