A    O
community    O

investigated    O
the    O
cause    O
of    O
the    O
poor    O

concluded    O
that    O
DirectDraw    B-SupportingStructure104361095

applications    O
were    O

Wide    O
adoption    O
of    O

led    O
to    O

being    O
extensively    O
used    O
in    O
the    O
late    O
1990s    O

refinement    O
of    O

from    O

in    O
addition    O
to    O
growing    O
diversity    O
in    O
3D    O

eventually    O

At    O
the    O

many    O
