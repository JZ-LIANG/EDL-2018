,    O
P.    O
G.    O
A.    O
H.    O
Voigt    O
patented    O
a    O
horn    B-Transducer104470953
loudspeaker    I-Transducer104470953
design    O
based    O
on    O
the    O
assumption    O
that    O
a    O
wave    O
front    O
traveling    O
through    O
the    O
horn    O
is    O
spherical    O
of    O
a    O
constant    O
radius    O
.    O

The    O
distance    O
between    O
adjacent    O
drivers    O
is    O
close    O
enough    O
that    O
they    O
constructively    O
interfere    O
with    O
each    O
other    O
to    O
send    O
sound    O
waves    O
farther    O
than    O
traditional    O
horn-loaded    B-Transducer104470953
loudspeakers    I-Transducer104470953
,    O
and    O
with    O
a    O
more    O
evenly    O
distributed    O
sound    O
output    O
pattern    O
.    O

Much    O
of    O
the    O
Vibratone    O
's    O
unique    O
tone    O
comes    O
from    O
the    O
fact    O
that    O
the    O
cabinet    O
uses    O
a    O
guitar    O
speaker    O
,    O
instead    O
of    O
a    O
horn    B-Transducer104470953
and    O
woofer    O
.    O

Many    O
feel    O
that    O
the    O
best    O
low    O
frequency    O
unit    O
for    O
hybrids    O
are    O
cone    O

mounted    O

since    O
they    O
possess    O
roughly    O
the    O
same    O
qualities    O
(    O
at    O

in    O
the    O
