the    O

compelled    O
Gaius    B-Tribune110728828
Marius    I-Tribune110728828
to    O
renounce    O
him    O
,    O

in    O
his    O
proscription    O

death    O

of    O

toward    O
Italy    O

Many    O
times    O
there    O
were    O
imposters    O
that    O
said    O
they    O
were    O
sons    O

Although    O
it    O

killed    O
by    O
Marsic    O
soldiers    O
,    O
at    O
least    O
one    O
source    O
states    O
that    O
he    O
was    O
killed    O
by    O
Gaius    O
Marius    O
the    O
Younger    O

,    O
who    O
was    O
furious    O
that    O

had    O
boasted    O
that    O
his    O

achievements    O
