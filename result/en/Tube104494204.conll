to    O
summarize    O

Dr.    O

solved    O
this    O

by    O
connecting    O

The    O
Schottky    B-Tube104494204

could    O
be    O
integrated    O

had    O
a    O

it    O
had    O
no    O
minority    O
carrier    O

and    O
it    O
was    O
faster    O
than    O
a    O
conventional    O
junction    O

.    O

This    O
can    O
be    O
achieved    O
by    O
applying    O
