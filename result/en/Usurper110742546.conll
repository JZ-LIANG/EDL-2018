The    O
last    O
time    O
it    O
was    O
probably    O
buried    O
while    O
"    O
Augusta    O

"    O
was    O
beleaguered    O
by    O
Clodius    B-Usurper110742546
Albinus    I-Usurper110742546
,    O
since    O

were    O
struck    O
196    O
AD    O
under    O

.    O

Following    O
the    O
Roman    O
conquest    O
of    O
Britain    O
,    O
it    O
was    O
administered    O
as    O
a    O
single    O
province    O
from    O
Camulodunum    O
(    O
Colchester    O
)    O
and    O
then    O
Londinium    O
(    O
London    O
)    O
until    O
the    O
Severan    O
Reforms    O
following    O
the    O
revolt    O
of    O
its    O
governor    O
Clodius    B-Usurper110742546
Albinus    I-Usurper110742546
.    O

In    O
196    O
,    O
II    O
"    O
Augusta    O
"    O
supported    O
the    O
claim    O
for    O
the    O
purple    O
of    O
the    O
governor    O
of    O
Britannia    O
,    O
Clodius    B-Usurper110742546

,    O
who    O
was    O
defeated    O
by    O
Septimius    O
Severus    O
.    O

Then    O
Severus    O
returned    O
to    O
Rome    O
due    O
to    O
Clodius    B-Usurper110742546
Albinus    I-Usurper110742546
's    O
rebellion    O
;    O
during    O
Severus    O
's    O
return    O
from    O
Mesopotamia    O
,    O
the    O
status    O
of    O
the    O
Parthian    O
Empire    O
was    O
very    O
disrupted    O
.    O

It    O
may    O
be    O
linked    O
to    O
the    O
political    O
crisis    O
that    O
emerged    O
in    O
late    O
2nd    O
century    O
when    O
the    O
governor    O
of    O
Britain    O
Clodius    B-Usurper110742546
Albinus    I-Usurper110742546
was    O
consolidating    O
his    O
power    O
after    O
claiming    O
the    O
right    O
of    O
succession    O
as    O
Roman    O
emperor    O
.    O

In    O
197    O
AD    O
Dio    O
Cassius    O
records    O
that    O
the    O
Caledonians    O
aided    O
in    O
a    O
further    O
attack    O
on    O
the    O
Roman    O
frontier    O
being    O
led    O
by    O
the    O
Maeatae    O
and    O
the    O
Brigantes    O
and    O
probably    O
inspired    O
by    O
the    O
removal    O
of    O
garrisons    O
on    O
Hadrian    O
's    O
Wall    O
by    O
Clodius    B-Usurper110742546
Albinus    I-Usurper110742546
.    O

During    O
the    O
course    O
of    O
the    O
civil    O
war    O
that    O
followed    O
the    O
election    O
of    O
Septimius    O
Severus    O
as    O
emperor    O
,    O
his    O
rival    O
,    O
Clodius    B-Usurper110742546
Albinus    I-Usurper110742546
,    O
set    O
forth    O
for    O
the    O
continent    O
in    O
197    O
with    O
the    O
Britannic    O
army    O
,    O
but    O
suffered    O
a    O
crushing    O
defeat    O
against    O
Severus’    O
troops    O
in    O
the    O
Battle    O
of    O
Lugdunum    O
(    O
Lyon    O
)    O
.    O

The    O
new    O
Guard    O
of    O
Septimius    O
Severus    O
made    O
their    O
mark    O
against    O
his    O
rival    O
Clodius    B-Usurper110742546
Albinus    I-Usurper110742546
at    O

in    O
197    O
,    O
and    O
accompanied    O
the    O
emperor    O
to    O
the    O
Orient    O
from    O
197    O
to    O

until    O
his    O
death    O
at    O
York    O
in    O
211    O
.    O

However    O
,    O
possibly    O
due    O
to    O
his    O
having    O
supported    O
the    O
rival    O
imperial    O
claimant    O
Clodius    B-Usurper110742546

,    O

to    O
the    O
year    O
193    O

,    O
in    O
which    O
there    O
were    O
five    O
claimants    O
for    O

.    O

It    O
was    O
during    O
this    O

fought    O
at    O
the    O

probably    O
until    O

a    O

to    O

to    O

The    O
ambitious    O
spirit    O
of    O
Galerius    O
was    O
only    O
just    O
over    O
this    O
disappointment    O
when    O
he    O
beheld    O
the    O
unexpected    O
loss    O
of    O
Italy    O
to    O
Maxentius    B-Usurper110742546

who    O
was    O
married    O
to    O
his    O

Valeria    O
Maximilla    O

He    O
was    O
trusted    O
enough    O
by    O
Galerius    O
that    O
in    O
307    O
he    O
was    O
sent    O
as    O
an    O
envoy    O
to    O
Maxentius    B-Usurper110742546
in    O
Italy    O
to    O
attempt    O
to    O
reach    O
some    O
agreement    O
about    O
the    O
latter    O
's    O
illegitimate    O
political    O
position    O
.    O

The    O
archaeologists    O
who    O
excavated    O
the    O
find    O
have    O
suggested    O
that    O
the    O
items    O
might    O
have    O
belonged    O
to    O
the    O
emperor    O
Maxentius    B-Usurper110742546
,    O
and    O
may    O
have    O
been    O
concealed    O
by    O
some    O
unknown    O
loyalist    O
followers    O
after    O
his    O
final    O
defeat    O
,    O
and    O
subsequent    O
death    O
.    O

In    O
late    O
306    O
,    O
Maximian    O
took    O
the    O
title    O
of    O
Augustus    O
again    O
and    O
aided    O
his    O
son    O
Maxentius    B-Usurper110742546
'    O
rebellion    O
in    O
Italy    O
.    O

Maximian    O
had    O
two    O
children    O
with    O
his    O
Syrian    O
wife    O

Eutropia    O

's    O
son    O
Maxentius    B-Usurper110742546

–    O

Catherine    O
of    O
Alexandria    O
,    O
seen    O
as    O
a    O
virgin    O
martyr    O
,    O
is    O
portrayed    O
with    O
her    O
wheel    O
of    O

taking    O
revenge    O
on    O

Emperor    O

.    O

In    O
spite    O
of    O
its    O
increasingly    O
marginal    O
role    O
in    O
the    O
Empire    O
,    O
Rome    O
retained    O
its    O
historic    O
prestige    O
,    O
and    O
this    O
period    O
saw    O
the    O
last    O
wave    O
of    O
construction    O
activity    O
:    O
Constantine    O
's    O
predecessor    O
Maxentius    B-Usurper110742546
built    O
buildings    O
such    O
as    O
its    O
basilica    O
in    O
the    O
Forum    O
,    O
Constantine    O
himself    O
erected    O
the    O
Arch    O
of    O
Constantine    O
to    O
celebrate    O
his    O
victory    O
over    O
the    O
former    O
,    O
and    O
Diocletian    O
built    O
the    O
greatest    O
baths    O
of    O
all    O
.    O

The    O
speech    O
is    O
peculiar    O
because    O
none    O
of    O
the    O
honoured    O
emperors    O
was    O
present    O
at    O
its    O
delivery    O
,    O
and    O
because    O
it    O
celebrates    O
Constantine    O
's    O
victory    O
over    O
Maxentius    B-Usurper110742546
(    O
at    O
the    O
Battle    O
of    O
Milvian    O
Bridge    O
)    O
in    O
312    O
,    O
avoiding    O
almost    O
any    O
reference    O
to    O
contemporaneous    O
events    O
.    O

Ruricius    O

in    O
308    O
,    O

was    O
completed    O
in    O

by    O

against    O
Maxentius    B-Usurper110742546

contains    O
perhaps    O
the    O
most    O
famous    O
scene    O
in    O
the    O
"    O
Life    O
of    O
Constantine    O
"    O
,    O

vision    O
of    O

horns    O
which    O
were    O
subdued    O
by    O
the    O
11th    O

identified    O
as    O
the    O
three    O

,    O
Maxentius    B-Usurper110742546

were    O

by    O

This    O
technique    O
was    O
adopted    O
during    O
the    O
whole    O
4th    O
century    O
,    O
and    O
is    O
typical    O
of    O

The    O
area    O
of    O

is    O
thought    O
to    O
have    O
formed    O
part    O
of    O
the    O
kingdom    O
of    O
Powys    O
,    O
whose    O
early    O
kings    O
claimed    O
descent    O
from    O
the    O
exile    O
Vortigern    B-Usurper110742546
.    O

The    O

also    O

with    O

This    O
attack    O
was    O
allegedly    O
perpetrated    O
by    O

,    O
governor    O
of    O
the    O

According    O
to    O
Nennius    O
,    O
Gwrangon    O
was    O
King    O
of    O
Kent    O
in    O
the    O
time    O
of    O
Vortigern    B-Usurper110742546
,    O
until    O
Vortigern    O
took    O
away    O
the    O
kingdom    O
and    O
gave    O
it    O
to    O
Hengist    O
;    O
but    O
Nennius    O
is    O
regarded    O
as    O
an    O
untrustworthy    O
source    O
,    O
and    O
"    O
Gwrangon    O
seems    O
to    O
have    O
been    O
transported    O
by    O
the    O
story    O
-    O
teller    O
into    O
Kent    O
from    O
Gwent    O
"    O
and    O
"    O
is    O
turned    O
into    O
an    O
imaginary    O
King    O
of    O
Kent    O
,    O
secretly    O
disposed    O
of    O
his    O
realm    O
in    O
favour    O
of    O
Hengist    O
,    O
whose    O

places    O

During    O

,    O
he    O
was    O
serving    O
as    O

from    O
Zenobia    B-Usurper110742546
to    O
the    O
emperor    O
Aurelian    O
.    O

not    O

and    O
in    O

of    O

As    O
the    O
title    O
suggests    O

it    O

a    O

that    O
the    O
author    O
claims    O
reported    O
by    O
a    O

it    O
is    O
therefore    O
possible    O
that    O
