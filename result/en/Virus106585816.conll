"    O
perceived    O
"    O
to    O

)    O
due    O
to    O
the    O
impossibility    O
of    O

Man-in-the-middle    B-Virus106585816
attack    I-Virus106585816
or    O
packet    O
sniffing    O
;    O
secondly    O
,    O
the    O
volumes    O
of    O
data    O
concerned    O
are    O
often    O
extremely    O
high    O
;    O
and    O
thirdly    O
,    O
setting    O
up    O

the    O

is    O
often    O
either    O

of    O

any    O

submitted    O
with    O

it    O
