Historically    O
,    O
the    O
concept    O
of    O
a    O
protector    O
developed    O
in    O
offshore    O
jurisdictions    O
where    O
settlors    O
were    O
(    O
perhaps    O
understandably    O
)    O
concerned    O
about    O
appointing    O
a    O
trust    O
company    O
in    O
a    O
small    O
,    O
distant    O
country    O
as    O
sole    O
trustee    O
of    O
an    O
offshore    B-Volition105652593
trust    I-Volition105652593
which    O
is    O
to    O
hold    O
a    O
great    O
deal    O

Senate    O
investigators    O
allege    O
that    O
the    O
Wyly    O
brothers    O
used    O
the    O
offshore    B-Volition105652593
trust    I-Volition105652593
to    O
buy    O

other    O
items    O
for    O
their    O
personal    O
use    O
.    O

There    O
are    O
two    O
likely    O
reasons    O
for    O
this    O
;    O
firstly    O
,    O
for    O
an    O
Offshore    O
Financial    O
Centre    O
,    O
the    O
British    O
Virgin    O
Islands    O
has    O
an    O
underdeveloped    O
banking    O
infrastructure    O
compared    O
to    O
(    O
for    O
example    O
)    O
the    O
Cayman    O
Islands    O
or    O
Jersey    O
and    O
so    O
comparatively    O
modest    O
sums    O
are    O
deposited    O
in    O
the    O
Territory    O
's    O
banks    O
;    O
secondly    O
,    O
the    O
withholding    O
tax    O
only    O
affects    O
deposits    O
held    O
by    O
natural    O
persons    O
-    O
because    O
most    O
offshore    O
tax    O
structuring    O
involves    O
the    O
use    O
of    O
either    O
an    O
offshore    O
company    O
or    O
an    O
offshore    B-Volition105652593
trust    I-Volition105652593
,    O
this    O
usually    O
takes    O
it    O
outside    O
the    O
scope    O
of    O
the    O
tax    O
