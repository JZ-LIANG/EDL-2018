—    O
probably    O
simply    O
owing    O

his    O

misdirecting    O

the    O

that    O

used    O
by    O

frontier    I-Wall104546855
.    O

The    O
reasons    O
for    O
planting    O
Rhineland    O
were    O
to    O
cater    O
to    O
the    O
growing    O

the    O

from    O

Bordeaux    O
.    O

In    O
addition    O
,    O
the    O

strengthened    O
its    O
border    O
defenses    O

His    O
most    O
significant    O
military    O
contribution    O
was    O
the    O

The    O
end    O
of    O
the    O
early    O
Middle    O
Ages    O
was    O
the    O
time    O
that    O
the    O
Welsh    O
language    O
transitioned    O
from    O
the    O
Primitive    O
Welsh    O
spoken    O
throughout    O
the    O
era    O
into    O
Old    O
Welsh    O
,    O
and    O
the    O
time    O
when    O
the    O
modern    O
England    O
–    O
Wales    O
border    O
would    O
take    O
its    O
near    O

final    O

An    O
alternative    O
suggestion    O
is    O
that    O
it    O
derives    O
from    O
Welsh    O
words    O
"    O
ystre    O
"    O
,    O
meaning    O
boundary    O

"    O
gwyl    O
"    O
,    O
meaning    O
watch    O

guard    O
;    O
a    O
combined    O
word    O
"    O

could    O
mean    O
