from    O
the    O
Eurasian    O
Steppe    O
,    O
who    O
often    O
appear    O
in    O
history    O
as    O
invaders    O
of    O

The    O
sixteenth    O
and    O
eighteenth    O
centuries    O
saw    O
a    O
series    O
of    O
splits    O
and    O
confederations    O
among    O
the    O
nomad    B-Wanderer110765679
Turkmen    O
tribes    O
,    O
who    O
remained    O
staunchly    O
independent    O
and    O
inspired    O
fear    O
in    O
their    O
neighbors    O
.    O

Since    O
they    O
were    O
home    O
dwellers    O
instead    O
of    O
nomads    B-Wanderer110765679
,    O
farming    O
was    O
essential    O
to    O
their    O
supply    O
of    O
food    O
.    O

Although    O
at    O
first    O
they    O
were    O
nomad    B-Wanderer110765679
or    O
seminomads    O
,    O
they    O
later    O
settled    O
,    O
but    O
were    O
usually    O
considered    O
foreigners    O

maintaining    O

but    O
rather    O
begin    O
to    O
adapt    O
