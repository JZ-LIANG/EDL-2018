The    O

the    O
extermination    O
of    O
Jews    O
during    O
the    O
Holocaust    B-WarCrime100782518

he    O

In    O
the    O

In    O

However    O
,    O
since    O

much    O
dialogue    O

at    O

taken    O

During    O
the    O
Holocaust    B-WarCrime100782518
era    O
,    O
a    O
Judenrat    O
was    O
established    O
in    O
the    O
town    O
,    O
where    O
the    O

Having    O
survived    O
the    O
Holocaust    B-WarCrime100782518
,    O
after    O
the    O
liberation    O
he    O
became    O

worked    O
at    O
the    O

However    O
,    O
many    O
relatives    O
became    O
victims    O
of    O
the    O
Holocaust    B-WarCrime100782518
.    O

It    O
is    O
estimated    O
that    O
out    O
of    O
almost    O
60,000    O
Jews    O
who    O
lived    O
in    O
Białystok    O
before    O
World    O

,    O
only    O
several    O

From    O
this    O
perspective    O
,    O
the    O
subtext    O
of    O
such    O
images    O
,    O
though    O
still    O
connotatively    O
open    O
to    O
interpretation    O
,    O
has    O
been    O
somewhat    O
restrained    O
by    O
familiarity    O
,    O
predominant    O
cultural    O
beliefs    O
regarding    O
the    O
Holocaust    B-WarCrime100782518
,    O
and    O
perhaps    O
by    O
overusage    O
.    O

Shocking    O
as    O
they    O
were    O
,    O
he    O
referred    O
to    O
them    O
often    O
as    O
teaching    O
examples    O
of    O
the    O
horrors    O
of    O
war    O
,    O
of    O
the    O
Holocaust    B-WarCrime100782518
,    O
and    O
to    O
underscore    O
the    O
veracity    O
of    O
his    O
strong    O
philosophical    O
and    O
ethical    O
beliefs    O
.    O

Schwartz    O
began    O
doing    O
research    O
on    O
the    O
subject    O
of    O
non    O
-    O
Jewish    O
Holocaust    B-WarCrime100782518
victims    O
after    O
she    O
converted    O
from    O
Roman    O
Catholicism    O
to    O

.    O

There    O
is    O
a    O
predominance    O
of    O

well    O
as    O
a    O
large    O
collection    O
of    O

and    O
photographs    O
which    O
attest    O
to    O
the    O
Holocaust    B-WarCrime100782518
in    O
which    O
many    O
Jewish    O
families    O
were    O
totally    O
decimated    O
.    O

There    O
are    O
1,000    O

to    O
Norman    O

,    O
the    O
