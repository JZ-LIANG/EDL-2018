Upon    O
attaining    O
this    O

During    O
the    O

;    O
however    O
,    O
this    O

and    O
although    O
an    O
eye    B-Weather111524662
developed    O
,    O
it    O
was    O
not    O
over    O
the    O
center    O
due    O
to    O
increasing    O
wind    O
shear    O
.    O

The    O
city    O
suffered    O
massive    O
damage    O
from    O
a    O
category    O
5    O
cyclone    O
named    O
Cyclone    O

in    O
March    O
2015    O
,    O
whose    O
eye    B-Weather111524662

passed    O
just    O

.    O

As    O
the    O
rear    O
eyewall    B-Weather111524662
passed    O
over    O
the    O

,    O
the    O

reversed    O
itself    O
,    O
breaking    O
the    O
dikes    O
along    O
the    O
northern    O
coast    O
of    O
the    O
lake    O
and    O
causing    O
a    O
similar    O

.    O

The    O
Joint    O
Typhoon    O
Warning    O
Center    O
(    O
JTWC    O
)    O
then    O
reported    O
later    O
that    O
day    O
that    O
the    O

However    O
,    O
Delia    O
was    O
not    O
classified    O

Shortly    O
thereafter    O
,    O
the    O
IMD    O
upgraded    O
the    O

The    O
1842    O

and    O
along    O
the    O
U.S.    O

A    O
tropical    B-Weather111524662

may    O
have    O
moved    O
into    O
the    O

The    O
purpose    O
of    O
a    O
windstorm    O
inspection    O
is    O
to    O
determine    O
the    O

in    O
the    O

a    O

Despite    O
its    O
flexibility    O
,    O
the    O

A    O

the    O
most    O
intense    O
tropical    B-Weather111524662

a    O
tropical    B-Weather111524662

,    O
the    O

,    O
the    O
National    O
Hurricane    O

The    O

was    O
able    O
to    O
organize    O
the    O

,    O
allowing    O
deep    O
convection    O

,    O
the    O
National    O
Hurricane    O
Center    O
(    O

indicated    O
on    O
August    O

that    O
the    O

had    O
a    O
90%    O

hazards    O

hazards    O
are    O
related    O
;    O
for    O

,    O
submarine    O
earthquakes    O
can    O
cause    O
tsunamis    O

and    O
erosion    O
.    O
Floods    O
and    O
wildfires    O
can    O

storm    I-Weather111524662
originating    O
in    O
the    O
Mediterranean    O
region    O
that    O

rapidly    O
during    O
that    O
day    O
.    O

Around    O
this    O
time    O
,    O
the    O

,    O
the    O
storm    O
weakened    O
below    O

weakened    O
a    O
subtropical    O
ridge    O
to    O
its    O

,    O
allowing    O
the    O

to    O
slowly    O
gain    O
latitude    O
,    O
and    O
on    O
October    O

to    O
the    O
JMA    O
,    O
this    O

did    O
not    O
occur    O
until    O
24    O
hours    O
later    O
.    O

Iwa    O

It    O
was    O

but    O
later    O
investigation    O
suggested    O
that    O
the    O
tornado    O
struck    O
a    O
location    O
8    O
km    O
away    O
and    O
did    O
not    O
affect    O

instead    O
,    O
based    O
on    O

other    O
evidence    O
,    O
the    O

(    O
12–13    O

,    O
was    O
the    O
likely    O
cause    O
of    O
the    O
capsizing    O

Intense    O
downburst    B-Weather111524662
may    O
also    O
cause    O
damage    O
paths    O
to    O
appear    O
continuous    O

although    O
this    O
was    O
more    O
an    O
issue    O
for    O
historic    O

as    O
such    O
damage    O
usually    O

American    O
Airlines    O
also    O
alleged    O
that    O
the    O
accident    O
was    O
due    O
to    O
a    O
downdraft    B-Weather111524662

than    O
pilot    O
error    O
