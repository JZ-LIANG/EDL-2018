Although    O
vertical    O

The    O
storm    O
became    O
disorganized    O
while    O

The    O

account    O
for    O

are    O
affected    O
by    O

However    O
,    O
vertical    O
wind    B-Wind111525955
shear    I-Wind111525955
leads    O
to    O
decreased    O

.    O

Vertical    O
wind    B-Wind111525955
shear    I-Wind111525955
forces    O
the    O
rainfall    O
pattern    O
around    O
a    O
tropical    O
cyclone    O
to    O
become    O
highly    O

Using    O
this    O
latter    O

appears    O
to    O
work    O
best    O

The    O
city    O
suffered    O
massive    O

from    O
a    O
category    O
5    O
cyclone    O
named    O
Cyclone    O
Pam    O
in    O
March    O
2015    O
,    O
whose    O
eye    B-Wind111525955

passed    O
just    O
to    O
the    O

Port    O
Vila    O
.    O

As    O
the    O
rear    O
eyewall    B-Wind111525955
passed    O
over    O
the    O

The    O
Joint    O
Typhoon    O
Warning    O
Center    O
(    O
JTWC    O

then    O
reported    O
later    O
that    O

that    O
the    O

with    O
low    O

However    O
,    O
Delia    O
was    O
not    O
classified    O
a    O

it    O

Shortly    O
thereafter    O
,    O
the    O
IMD    O
upgraded    O
the    O

The    O
next    O
day    O
the    O

A    O
well    O

quickly    O
developed    O
early    O
on    O

following    O
day    O
,    O
the    O

November    O
30    O
,    O
the    O
eye    B-Wind111525955

Ulithi    O
in    O
the    O

began    O
to    O
develop    O

that    O

and    O
by    O
early    O
August    O

,    O
the    O

was    O
just    O

Rapid    O

To    O

On    O
March    O
19    O
,    O
the    O

A    O

Ludlum    O
(    O
1963    O

,    O
and    O
it    O
is    O
possible    O
that    O
Brownsville    O

As    O
a    O
result    O
,    O
wind    O
shear    O
displaced    O

the    O

the    O

After    O

Late    O
on    O
the    O

Nuri    O
began    O
to    O
form    O
an    O

so    O
the    O

The    O

and    O
the    O

On    O
October    O

By    O

on    O
February    O
12    O
,    O
the    O

Around    O

Intensification    O
of    O
the    O

the    O
