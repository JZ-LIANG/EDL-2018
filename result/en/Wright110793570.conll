In    O
a    O
family    O
of    O
civil    O
engineers    O
,    O
his    O
father    O
was    O
engineer    O
of    O
Pendleton    O
Colliery    O
and    O
Nantlle    O
Railway    O
,    O
while    O

Stephenson    O
and    O
cousin    O
Robert    B-Wright110793570

were    O
prolific    O
railway    O
engineers    O
.    O

Designed    O
by    O
Robert    B-Wright110793570
Stephenson    I-Wright110793570
,    O
the    O
class    O
was    O
introduced    O
into    O
service    O
between    O
November    O
1838    O
and    O
November    O
1841    O
,    O

withdrawn    O
between    O
April    O
1864    O
and    O
September    O
1871    O
.    O

One    O
noteworthy    O
point    O
in    O
his    O
railway    O
practice    O
was    O
his    O
advocacy    O
,    O
in    O
opposition    O
to    O
Robert    B-Wright110793570
Stephenson    I-Wright110793570
,    O
of    O
steeper    O
gradients    O
than    O
had    O
previously    O
been    O
thought    O
desirable    O
or    O
possible    O
,    O
and    O
so    O
far    O
back    O
as    O
1838    O
he    O
expressed    O
decided    O
disapproval    O
of    O
the    O
maintenance    O
of    O
the    O
broad    O
gauge    O
on    O
the    O
Great    O
Western    O
,    O
because    O
of    O
the    O
troubles    O
he    O
foresaw    O
it    O
would    O
lead    O
to    O
in    O
connection    O
with    O
future    O
railway    O
extension    O
,    O
and    O
because    O
he    O
objected    O
in    O
general    O
to    O
breaks    O
of    O
gauge    O
in    O
the    O
lines    O
of    O
a    O
country    O
.    O

In    O
1850    O
the    O
Swiss    O
Federal    O
Council    O
invited    O
the    O
two    O
British    O
engineers    O
,    O
Robert    B-Wright110793570
Stephenson    I-Wright110793570
and    O
Henry    O
Swinburne    O
to    O
draw    O
up    O
plans    O
for    O
a    O
railway    O
network    O
for    O
the    O
Swiss    O
Confederation    O
.    O

The    O
long    O
boiler    O

was    O
the    O
object    O
of    O
a    O
patent    O
by    O
Robert    B-Wright110793570
Stephenson    I-Wright110793570
and    O
the    O
name    O
became    O
synonymous    O
with    O
the    O
pattern    O
.    O

An    O
agreement    O
was    O
set    O

George    B-Wright110793570
Stephenson    I-Wright110793570
built    O
a    O

Stockton    O
-    O
on    O

This    O
brought    O
about    O
the    O
development    O
of    O
transport    O
into    O
the    O
area    O
,    O
including    O

Railway    O
(    O

hence    O
onwards    O
via    O
to    O
Newport    O
on    O
the    O
River    O
Tees    O
.    O

An    O
alternative    O
route    O
was    O
proposed    O
by    O
George    B-Wright110793570
Stephenson    I-Wright110793570
,    O
who    O
had    O
surveyed    O
the    O

in    O
1835    O
.    O

He    O
was    O
initially    O
ignored    O
;    O
but    O
the    O
building    O
of    O
the    O
Liverpool    O
and    O
Manchester    O
Railway    O
attracted    O
greater    O
interest    O
locally    O
,    O
and    O
with    O
the    O
support    O
of    O
some    O

George    B-Wright110793570
Stephenson    I-Wright110793570
made    O
his    O
first    O
steam    O
locomotive    O
in    O
1813    O
(    O
patented    O

)    O
for    O
the    O
Killingworth    O

In    O
1821    O
,    O
a    O
wagonway    O

,    O
George    B-Wright110793570
Stephenson    I-Wright110793570
successfully    O
argued    O
that    O
horse    O
-    O
drawn    O
wagonways    O
were    O
obsolete    O
and    O
a    O
steam    O

railway    O
could    O
carry    O
50    O
